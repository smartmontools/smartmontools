\fBsmartd\fP \- SMART Disk Monitoring Daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smartd [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" %IF NOT OS ALL
.\"! [This man page is generated for the OS_MAN_FILTER version of smartmontools.
.\"! It does not contain info specific to other platforms.]
.\"! .PP
.\" %ENDIF NOT OS ALL
\fBsmartd\fP is a daemon that monitors the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and
Reporting Technology (SMART) system built into most ATA/SATA and SCSI/SAS
hard drives and solid-state drives.
The purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability of the hard drive
and predict drive failures, and to carry out different types of drive
self-tests.
This version of \fBsmartd\fP is compatible with
ACS-3, ACS-2, ATA8-ACS, ATA/ATAPI-7 and earlier standards
(see \fBREFERENCES\fP below).

\fBsmartd\fP will attempt to enable SMART monitoring on ATA devices
(equivalent to \fBsmartctl -s on\fP) and polls these and SCSI devices
every 30 minutes (configurable), logging SMART errors and changes of
SMART Attributes via the SYSLOG interface.  The default location for
these SYSLOG notifications and warnings is system-dependent
(typically \fB/var/log/messages\fP or \fB/var/log/syslog\fP).
To change this default location, please see the \fB\'-l\'\fP
command-line option described below.

In addition to logging to a file, \fBsmartd\fP can also be configured
to send email warnings if problems are detected.  Depending upon the
type of problem, you may want to run self-tests on the disk, back up
the disk, replace the disk, or use a manufacturer\'s utility to force
reallocation of bad or unreadable disk sectors.  If disk problems are
detected, please see the \fBsmartctl\fP manual page and the
\fBsmartmontools\fP web page/FAQ for further guidance.

If you send a \fBUSR1\fP signal to \fBsmartd\fP it will immediately
check the status of the disks, and then return to polling the disks
every 30 minutes. See the \fB\'\-i\'\fP option below for additional
details.

\fBsmartd\fP can be configured at start-up using the configuration
file \fB/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\fP (Windows: \fBEXEDIR/smartd.conf\fP).
If the configuration file is subsequently modified, \fBsmartd\fP
can be told to re-read the configuration file by sending it a
\fBHUP\fP signal, for example with the command:
.br
\fBkillall -HUP smartd\fP.
.br
.\" %IF OS Windows
(Windows: See NOTES below.)
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows

On startup, if \fBsmartd\fP finds a syntax error in the configuration
file, it will print an error message and then exit. However if
\fBsmartd\fP is already running, then is told with a \fBHUP\fP signal
to re-read the configuration file, and then find a syntax error in
this file, it will print an error message and then continue, ignoring
the contents of the (faulty) configuration file, as if the \fBHUP\fP
signal had never been received.

When \fBsmartd\fP is running in debug mode, the \fBINT\fP signal
(normally generated from a shell with CONTROL-C) is treated in the
same way as a \fBHUP\fP signal: it makes \fBsmartd\fP reload its
configuration file. To exit \fBsmartd\fP use CONTROL-\e
.\" %IF OS Windows
(Windows: CONTROL-Break).
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows

On startup, in the absence of the configuration file
\fB/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\fP, the \fBsmartd\fP daemon first scans for all
devices that support SMART.  The scanning is done as follows:
.\" %IF OS Linux
.IP \fBLINUX:\fP 9
Examine all entries \fB"/dev/hd[a-t]"\fP for IDE/ATA
devices, and \fB"/dev/sd[a-z]"\fP, \fB"/dev/sd[a-c][a-z]"\fP
for ATA/SATA or SCSI/SAS devices.
Disks behind RAID controllers are not included.
.\" %ENDIF OS Linux

Examine all entries \fB"/dev/sd[a\-z]"\fP, \fB"/dev/sd[a\-c][a\-z]"\fP
and \fB"/dev/sdd[a\-x]"\fP ("\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive[0\-127]") for
IDE/(S)ATA and SCSI disk devices.

If a 3ware 9000 controller is installed, examine all entries
\fB"/dev/sdX,N"\fP for the first logical drive (\'unit\'
\fB"/dev/sdX"\fP) and all physical disks (\'ports\' \fB",N"\fP)
detected behind this controller. Same for a second controller if present.

If directive \'\-d csmi\' or no \'\-d\' directive is specified,
examine all entries \fB"/dev/csmi[0\-9],N"\fP for drives behind an Intel
ICHxR controller with RST driver.

Disks behind Areca RAID controllers are not included.
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows Cygwin
.PP
\fBsmartd\fP then monitors
for \fIall\fP possible SMART errors (corresponding to the \fB\'\-a\'\fP
Directive in the configuration file; see the \fBsmartd.conf\fP(5) man page).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A PREFIX, \-\-attributelog=PREFIX
Writes \fBsmartd\fP attribute information (normalized and raw
attribute values) to files \'PREFIX\'\'MODEL\-SERIAL.ata.csv\' or \'PREFIX\'\'VENDOR\-MODEL\-SERIAL.scsi.csv\'.  At each
check cycle attributes are logged as a line of semicolon separated triplets
of the form "attribute-ID;attribute-norm-value;attribute-raw-value;".
For SCSI devices error counters and temperature recorded in the form "counter-name;counter-value;"
Each line is led by a date string of the form "yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS" (in UTC).

.\" %IF ENABLE_ATTRIBUTELOG
If this option is not specified, attribute information is written to files
\'/usr/local/var/lib/smartmontools/attrlog.MODEL\-SERIAL.ata.csv\'.
To disable attribute log files, specify this option with an empty string
argument: \'-A ""\'.
.\" %ENDIF ENABLE_ATTRIBUTELOG
MODEL and SERIAL are build from drive identify information, invalid
characters are replaced by underline.

If the PREFIX has the form \'/path/dir/\' (e.g. \'/var/lib/smartd/\'), then
files \'MODEL\-SERIAL.ata.csv\' are created in directory \'/path/dir\'.
If the PREFIX has the form \'/path/name\' (e.g. \'/var/lib/misc/attrlog\-\'),
then files 'nameMODEL\-SERIAL.ata.csv' are created in directory '/path/'.
The path must be absolute, except if debug mode is enabled.
.TP
.B \-B [+]FILE, \-\-drivedb=[+]FILE
[ATA only] Read the drive database from FILE.  The new database replaces
the built in database by default.  If \'+\' is specified, then the new entries
prepend the built in entries.
Please see the \fBsmartctl\fP(8) man page for further details.
.TP
.B \-c FILE, \-\-configfile=FILE
Read \fBsmartd\fP configuration Directives from FILE, instead of from
the default location \fB/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\fP (Windows: \fBEXEDIR/smartd.conf\fP).
If FILE does \fBnot\fP exist, then \fBsmartd\fP will print an error
message and exit with nonzero status.  Thus, \'\-c /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\'
can be used to verify the existence of the default configuration file.

By using \'\-\' for FILE, the configuration is read from standard
input. This is useful for commands like:
.nf
.B echo /dev/sdb \-m user@home \-M test | smartd \-c \- \-q onecheck
.fi
to perform quick and simple checks without a configuration file.
.\" %IF ENABLE_CAPABILITIES
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-capabilities
[Linux only] Use libcap-ng to drop unneeded Linux process \fBcapabilities\fP(7).
The following capabilities are kept: CAP_SYS_ADMIN, CAP_SYS_RAWIO, CAP_MKNOD.

Warning: Mail notification does not work when used.
.\" %ENDIF ENABLE_CAPABILITIES
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Runs \fBsmartd\fP in "debug" mode. In this mode, it displays status
information to STDOUT rather than logging it to SYSLOG and does not
\fBfork\fP(2) into the background and detach from the controlling
terminal.  In this mode, \fBsmartd\fP also prints more verbose
information about what it is doing than when operating in "daemon"
mode. In this mode, the \fBINT\fP signal (normally generated from a
terminal with CONTROL-C) makes \fBsmartd\fP reload its configuration
file.  Please use CONTROL-\e to exit
.\" %IF OS Windows
(Windows: CONTROL-Break).

[Windows only] The "debug" mode can be toggled by the command
\fBsmartd sigusr2\fP. A new console for debug output is opened when
debug mode is enabled.
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-showdirectives
Prints a list (to STDOUT) of all the possible Directives which may
appear in the configuration file /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf, and then exits.
These Directives are described in the \fBsmartd.conf\fP(5) man page.
They may appear in the configuration file following the device name.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help, \-\-usage
Prints usage message to STDOUT and exits.
.TP
.B \-i N, \-\-interval=N
Sets the interval between disk checks to \fIN\fP seconds, where
\fIN\fP is a decimal integer.  The minimum allowed value is ten and
the maximum is the largest positive integer that can be represented on
your system (often 2^31-1).  The default is 1800 seconds.

Note that the superuser can make \fBsmartd\fP check the status of the
disks at any time by sending it the \fBSIGUSR1\fP signal, for example
with the command:
.nf
.B kill -SIGUSR1 <pid>
.fi
where \fB<pid>\fP is the process id number of \fBsmartd\fP.  One may
also use:
.nf
.B killall -USR1 smartd
.fi
for the same purpose.
.br
.\" %IF OS Windows
(Windows: See NOTES below.)
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows
.TP
.B \-l FACILITY, \-\-logfacility=FACILITY
Uses syslog facility FACILITY to log the messages from \fBsmartd\fP.
Here FACILITY is one of \fIlocal0\fP, \fIlocal1\fP, ..., \fIlocal7\fP,
or \fIdaemon\fP [default].  If this command-line option is not used,
then by default messages from \fBsmartd\fP are logged to the facility
\fIdaemon\fP.

If you would like to have \fBsmartd\fP messages logged somewhere other
than the default location, include (for example) \'\-l local3\' in its
start up argument list.
Tell the syslog daemon to log all messages from facility \fBlocal3\fP
to (for example) \'/var/log/smartd.log\'.

For more detailed information, please refer to the man pages for
the local syslog daemon, typically \fBsyslogd\fP(8), \fBsyslog-ng\fP(8)
or \fBrsyslogd\fP(8).
.\" %IF OS Cygwin

Cygwin: If no \fBsyslogd\fP is running, the \'\-l\' option has no effect.
In this case, all \fBsyslog\fP messages are written to Windows event log.
.\" %ENDIF OS Cygwin
.\" %IF OS Windows

Windows: Some \fBsyslog\fP functionality is implemented
internally in \fBsmartd\fP as follows: If no \'\-l\' option
(or \'\-l daemon\') is specified, messages are written to Windows
event log or to file \fB./smartd.log\fP if event log is not available
(access denied). By specifying other values of FACILITY,
log output is redirected as follows:
\'\-l local0\' to file \fB./smartd.log\fP,
\'\-l local1\' to standard output (redirect with \'>\' to any file),
\'\-l local2\' to standard error,
\'\-l local[3-7]\': to file \fB./smartd[1-5].log\fP.
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no\-fork
Do not fork into background; this is useful when executed from modern
init methods like initng, minit or supervise.
.\" %IF OS Cygwin

On Cygwin, this allows running \fBsmartd\fP as service via cygrunsrv,
see NOTES below.
.\" %ENDIF OS Cygwin
.\" %IF OS Windows

On Windows, this option is not available, use \'\-\-service\' instead.
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows
.TP
.B \-p NAME, \-\-pidfile=NAME
Writes pidfile \fINAME\fP containing the \fBsmartd\fP Process ID
number (PID).  To avoid symlink attacks make sure the directory to
which pidfile is written is only writable for root.  Without this
option, or if the \-\-debug option is given, no PID file is written on
startup.  If \fBsmartd\fP is killed with a maskable signal then the
pidfile is removed.
.TP
.B \-q WHEN, \-\-quit=WHEN
Specifies when, if ever, \fBsmartd\fP should exit.  The valid
arguments are to this option are:

.I nodev
\- Exit if there are no devices to monitor, or if any errors are found
at startup in the configuration file.  This is the default.

.I errors
\- Exit if there are no devices to monitor, or if any errors are found
in the configuration file /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf at startup or whenever it
is reloaded.

.I nodevstartup
\- Exit if there are no devices to monitor at startup.  But continue
to run if no devices are found whenever the configuration file is
reloaded.

.I never
\- Only exit if a fatal error occurs (no remaining system memory,
invalid command line arguments). In this mode, even if there are no
devices to monitor, or if the configuration file
\fB/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\fP has errors, \fBsmartd\fP will continue to run,
waiting to load a configuration file listing valid devices.

.I onecheck
\- Start \fBsmartd\fP in debug mode, then register devices, then check
device\'s SMART status once, and then exit with zero exit status if all
of these steps worked correctly.

This last option is intended for \'distribution-writers\' who want to
create automated scripts to determine whether or not to automatically
start up \fBsmartd\fP after installing smartmontools.  After starting
\fBsmartd\fP with this command-line option, the distribution\'s install
scripts should wait a reasonable length of time (say ten seconds).  If
\fBsmartd\fP has not exited with zero status by that time, the script
should send \fBsmartd\fP a SIGTERM or SIGKILL and assume that
\fBsmartd\fP will not operate correctly on the host.  Conversely, if
\fBsmartd\fP exits with zero status, then it is safe to run
\fBsmartd\fP in normal daemon mode. If \fBsmartd\fP is unable to
monitor any devices or encounters other problems then it will return
with non-zero exit status.

.I showtests
\- Start \fBsmartd\fP in debug mode, then register devices, then write
a list of future scheduled self tests to stdout, and then exit with zero
exit status if all of these steps worked correctly.
Device's SMART status is not checked.

This option is intended to test whether the '\-s REGEX' directives in
smartd.conf will have the desired effect. The output lists the next test
schedules, limited to 5 tests per type and device. This is followed by a
summary of all tests of each device within the next 90 days.
.TP
.B \-r TYPE, \-\-report=TYPE
Intended primarily to help
.B smartmontools
developers understand the behavior of
.B smartmontools
on non-conforming or poorly-conforming hardware.  This option reports
details of
\fBsmartd\fP
transactions with the device.  The option can be used multiple times.
When used just once, it shows a record of the ioctl() transactions
with the device.  When used more than once, the detail of these ioctl()
transactions are reported in greater detail.  The valid arguments to
this option are:

.I ioctl
\- report all ioctl() transactions.

.I ataioctl
\- report only ioctl() transactions with ATA devices.

.I scsiioctl
\- report only ioctl() transactions with SCSI devices.

Any argument may include a positive integer to specify the level of
detail that should be reported.  The argument should be followed by a
comma then the integer with no spaces.  For example, \fIataioctl,2\fP
The default level is 1, so \'\-r ataioctl,1\' and \'\-r ataioctl\' are
equivalent.
.TP
.B \-s PREFIX, \-\-savestates=PREFIX
Reads/writes \fBsmartd\fP state information from/to files
\'PREFIX\'\'MODEL\-SERIAL.ata.state\' or \'PREFIX\'\'VENDOR\-MODEL\-SERIAL.scsi.state\'. 
This preserves SMART attributes, drive min and max temperatures (\-W directive),
info about last sent warning email
(\-m directive), and the time of next check of the self-test REGEXP
(\-s directive) across boot cycles.

.\" %IF ENABLE_SAVESTATES
If this option is not specified, state information is maintained in files
\'/usr/local/var/lib/smartmontools/smartd.MODEL\-SERIAL.ata.state\' for ATA devices and
\'/usr/local/var/lib/smartmontools/smartd.VENDOR\-MODEL\-SERIAL.scsi.state\' for SCSI devices.
To disable state files, specify this option with an empty string
argument: \'\-s ""\'.
.\" %ENDIF ENABLE_SAVESTATES
MODEL and SERIAL are build from drive identify information, invalid
characters are replaced by underline.

If the PREFIX has the form \'/path/dir/\' (e.g. \'/var/lib/smartd/\'), then
files \'MODEL\-SERIAL.ata.state\' are created in directory \'/path/dir\'.
If the PREFIX has the form \'/path/name\' (e.g. \'/var/lib/misc/smartd\-\'),
then files 'nameMODEL\-SERIAL.ata.state' are created in directory '/path/'.
The path must be absolute, except if debug mode is enabled.

The state information files are read on smartd startup. The files are
always (re)written after reading the configuration file, before rereading
the configuration file (SIGHUP), before smartd shutdown, and after a check
forced by SIGUSR1. After a normal check cycle, a file is only rewritten if
an important change (which usually results in a SYSLOG output) occurred.
.TP
.B \-w PATH, \-\-warnexec=PATH
Run the executable PATH instead of the default script when smartd
needs to send warning messages.  PATH must point to an executable binary
file or script.
The default script is
.\" %IF NOT OS Windows
\fB/usr/local/etc/smartd_warning.sh\fP.

.\" %IF OS Windows
.TP
.B \-\-service
[Windows only] Enables \fBsmartd\fP to run as a Windows service.
The option must be specified in the service command line as the first
argument. It should not be used from console.
See NOTES below for details.
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version, \-\-license, \-\-copyright
Prints version, copyright, license, home page and SVN revision
information for your copy of \fBsmartd\fP to STDOUT and then exits.
Please include this information if you are reporting bugs or problems.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B smartd
.br
Runs the daemon in forked mode. This is the normal way to run
\fBsmartd\fP.
Entries are logged to SYSLOG.

.B smartd -d -i 30
.br
Run in foreground (debug) mode, checking the disk status
every 30 seconds.

.B smartd -q onecheck
.br
Registers devices, and checks the status of the devices exactly
once. The exit status (the shell
.B $?
variable) will be zero if all went well, and nonzero if no devices
were detected or some other problem was encountered.

Note that \fBsmartmontools\fP provides a start-up script in
\fB/usr/local/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd\fP which is responsible for starting and
stopping the daemon via the normal init interface.  Using this script,
you can start \fBsmartd\fP by giving the command:
.nf
.B /usr/local/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd start
.fi
and stop it by using the command:
.nf
.B /usr/local/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd stop
.fi

.SH CONFIGURATION
The syntax of the \fBsmartd.conf\fP(5) file is discussed separately.

.SH NOTES
\fBsmartd\fP
will make log entries at loglevel 
.B LOG_INFO
if the Normalized SMART Attribute values have changed, as reported using the
.B \'\-t\', \'\-p\',
or
.B \'\-u\'
Directives. For example:
.nf
.B \'Device: /dev/sda, SMART Attribute: 194 Temperature_Celsius changed from 94 to 93\'
.fi
Note that in this message, the value given is the \'Normalized\' not the \'Raw\' 
Attribute value (the disk temperature in this case is about 22
Celsius).  The 
.B \'-R\'
and 
.B \'-r\'
Directives modify this behavior, so that the information is printed
with the Raw values as well, for example:
.nf
.B \'Device: /dev/sda, SMART Attribute: 194 Temperature_Celsius changed from 94 [Raw 22] to 93 [Raw 23]\'
.fi
Here the Raw values are the actual disk temperatures in Celsius.  The
way in which the Raw values are printed, and the names under which the
Attributes are reported, is governed by the various
.B \'-v Num,Description\'
Directives described previously.

Please see the
.B smartctl
manual page for further explanation of the differences between
Normalized and Raw Attribute values.

\fBsmartd\fP
will make log entries at loglevel
.B LOG_CRIT
if a SMART Attribute has failed, for example:
.nf
.B \'Device: /dev/sdc, Failed SMART Attribute: 5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct\'
.fi
 This loglevel is used for reporting enabled by the
.B \'\-H\', \-f\', \'\-l\ selftest\',
and
.B \'\-l\ error\'
Directives. Entries reporting failure of SMART Prefailure Attributes
should not be ignored: they mean that the disk is failing.  Use the
.B smartctl
utility to investigate. 

.\" %IF OS Solaris
Under Solaris with the default \fB/etc/syslog.conf\fP configuration,
messages below loglevel \fBLOG_NOTICE\fP will \fBnot\fP be recorded.
Hence all \fBsmartd\fP messages with loglevel \fBLOG_INFO\fP will be
lost.  If you want to use the existing daemon facility to log all
messages from \fBsmartd\fP, you should change \fB/etc/syslog.conf\fP
from:
.nf
       ...;daemon.notice;...        /var/adm/messages
.fi
to read:
.nf
       ...;daemon.info;...          /var/adm/messages
.fi
Alternatively, you can use a local facility to log messages: please
see the \fBsmartd\fP '\-l' command-line option described above.

.\" %ENDIF OS Solaris
.\" %IF OS Cygwin
The Cygwin Version of \fBsmartd\fP can be run as a service via the
cygrunsrv tool. The start-up script provides Cygwin-specific commands
to install and remove the service:
.nf
.B /usr/local/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd install [options]
.B /usr/local/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd remove
.fi
The service can be started and stopped by the start-up script as usual
(see \fBEXAMPLES\fP above).

.\" %ENDIF OS Cygwin
.\" %IF OS Windows
On Windows, the log messages are written to the event log or to a file.
See documentation of the '\-l FACILITY' option above for details.

On Windows, the following built-in commands can be used to control
\fBsmartd\fP, if running as a daemon:

\'\fBsmartd status\fP\' \- check status

\'\fBsmartd stop\fP\' \- stop smartd

\'\fBsmartd reload\fP\' \- reread config file

\'\fBsmartd restart\fP\' \- restart smartd

\'\fBsmartd sigusr1\fP\' \- check disks now

\'\fBsmartd sigusr2\fP\' \- toggle debug mode

The Windows Version of \fBsmartd\fP has buildin support for services:

\'\fBsmartd install [options]\fP\' installs a service
named "smartd" (display name "SmartD Service") using the command line
\'/INSTALLPATH/smartd.exe \-\-service [options]\'.
This also installs smartd.exe as a event message file for the Windows
event viewer.

\'\fBsmartd remove\fP\' can later be used to remove the service and
event message entries from the registry.

Upon startup, the smartd service changes the working directory
to its own installation path. If smartd.conf and blat.exe are stored
in this directory, no \'-c\' option and \'-M exec\' directive is needed.

The debug mode (\'\-d\', \'\-q onecheck\') does not work if smartd is
running as service.

The service can be controlled as usual with Windows commands \'net\'
or \'sc\' (\'\fBnet start smartd\fP\', \'\fBnet stop smartd\fP\').

Pausing the service (\'\fBnet pause smartd\fP\') sets the interval between
disk checks (\'\-i N\') to infinite.

Continuing the paused service (\'\fBnet continue smartd\fP\') resets the
interval and rereads the configuration file immediately (like \fBSIGHUP\fP):

Continuing a still running service (\'\fBnet continue smartd\fP\' without
preceding \'\fBnet pause smartd\fP\') does not reread configuration but
checks disks immediately (like \fBSIGUSR1\fP).

.\" %ENDIF OS Windows
.SH LOG TIMESTAMP TIMEZONE
When \fBsmartd\fP makes log entries, these are time-stamped.  The time
stamps are in the computer's local time zone, which is generally set
using either the environment variable \'\fBTZ\fP\' or using a
time-zone file such as \fB/etc/localtime\fP.  You may wish to change
the timezone while \fBsmartd\fP is running (for example, if you carry
a laptop to a new time-zone and don't reboot it).  Due to a bug in the
\fBtzset\fP(3) function of many unix standard C libraries, the
time-zone stamps of \fBsmartd\fP might not change.  For some systems,
\fBsmartd\fP will work around this problem \fIif\fP the time-zone is
set using \fB/etc/localtime\fP. The work-around \fIfails\fP if the
time-zone is set using the \'\fBTZ\fP\' variable (or a file that it
points to).

.SH RETURN VALUES
The return value (exit status) of 
\fBsmartd\fP
can have the following values:
.TP
.B 0:
Daemon startup successful, or \fBsmartd\fP was killed by a SIGTERM (or in debug mode, a SIGQUIT).
.TP
.B 1:

ran out of memory during startup.
.TP
.B 9:
A compile time constant of\fB smartd\fP was too small.  This can be caused by an
excessive number of disks, or by lines in \fB /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\fP that are too long.
Please report this problem to \fB smartmontools-support@lists.sourceforge.net\fP.
.TP
.B 10:
An inconsistency was found in \fBsmartd\fP\'s internal data
structures. This should never happen.  It must be due to either a
coding or compiler bug.  \fIPlease\fP report such failures to
smartmontools developers, see REPORTING BUGS below.
.TP
.B 16:
A device explicitly listed in
.B /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf
can\'t be monitored.
.TP
.B 17:
\fBsmartd\fP
didn\'t find any devices to monitor.
.TP
.B 254:
When in daemon mode,
\fBsmartd\fP
received a SIGINT or SIGQUIT.  (Note that in debug mode, SIGINT has
the same effect as SIGHUP, and makes \fBsmartd\fP reload its
configuration file. SIGQUIT has the same effect as SIGTERM and causes
\fBsmartd\fP to exit with zero exit status.
.TP
.B 132 and above
\fBsmartd\fP
was killed by a signal that is not explicitly listed above.  The exit
status is then 128 plus the signal number.  For example if
\fBsmartd\fP
is killed by SIGKILL (signal 9) then the exit status is 137.

The first smartmontools code was derived from the smartsuite package,
written by Michael Cornwell, and from the previous UCSC smartsuite package.
This code was originally developed as a
Senior Thesis by Michael Cornwell at the Concurrent Systems Laboratory
(now part of the Storage Systems Research Center), Jack Baskin School
of Engineering, University of California, Santa
Cruz. \fBhttp://ssrc.soe.ucsc.edu/\fP .

An introductory article about smartmontools is \fIMonitoring Hard
Disks with SMART\fP, by Bruce Allen, Linux Journal, January 2004,
pages 74-77. This is \fBhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6983\fP
online.

If you would like to understand better how SMART works, and what it
does, a good place to start is with Sections 4.8 and 6.54 of the first
volume of the \'AT Attachment with Packet Interface-7\' (ATA/ATAPI-7)
specification Revision 4b.  This documents the SMART functionality which the
\fBsmartmontools\fP utilities provide access to.

The functioning of SMART was originally defined by the SFF-8035i
revision 2 and the SFF-8055i revision 1.4 specifications.  These are
publications of the Small Form Factors (SFF) Committee.

Links to these and other documents may be found on the Links page of the
\fBsmartmontools\fP Wiki at \fBhttp://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Links\fP .
