.Sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" %IF NOT OS ALL
.\"! [This man page is generated for the OS_MAN_FILTER version of smartmontools.
.\"! It does not contain info specific to other platforms.]
.\"! .PP
.\" %ENDIF NOT OS ALL
\fBsmartd\fP is a daemon that monitors the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and
Reporting Technology (SMART) system built into most ATA/SATA and SCSI/SAS
hard drives and solid-state drives.
The purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability of the hard drive
and predict drive failures, and to carry out different types of drive
self-tests.
This version of \fBsmartd\fP is compatible with
ACS-3, ACS-2, ATA8-ACS, ATA/ATAPI-7 and earlier standards
(see \fBREFERENCES\fP below).
.PP
\fBsmartd\fP will attempt to enable SMART monitoring on ATA devices
(equivalent to \fBsmartctl \-s on\fP) and polls these and SCSI devices
every 30 minutes (configurable), logging SMART errors and changes of
SMART Attributes via the SYSLOG interface.  The default location for
these SYSLOG notifications and warnings is system-dependent
(typically \fB/var/log/messages\fP or \fB/var/log/syslog\fP).
To change this default location, please see the \*(Aq\-l\*(Aq
command-line option described below.
.PP
In addition to logging to a file, \fBsmartd\fP can also be configured
to send email warnings if problems are detected.  Depending upon the
type of problem, you may want to run self-tests on the disk, back up
the disk, replace the disk, or use a manufacturer's utility to force
reallocation of bad or unreadable disk sectors.  If disk problems are
detected, please see the \fBsmartctl\fP manual page and the
\fBsmartmontools\fP web page/FAQ for further guidance.
.PP
If you send a \fBUSR1\fP signal to \fBsmartd\fP it will immediately
check the status of the disks, and then return to polling the disks
every 30 minutes.
See the \*(Aq\-i\*(Aq option below for additional details.
.PP
\fBsmartd\fP can be configured at start-up using the configuration
file \fB/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\fP (Windows: \fBEXEDIR/smartd.conf\fP).
If the configuration file is subsequently modified, \fBsmartd\fP
can be told to re-read the configuration file by sending it a
\fBHUP\fP signal, for example with the command:
.br
\fBkillall \-HUP smartd\fP.
.br
.\" %IF OS Windows
(Windows: See NOTES below.)
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows
.PP
On startup, if \fBsmartd\fP finds a syntax error in the configuration
file, it will print an error message and then exit.  However if
\fBsmartd\fP is already running, then is told with a \fBHUP\fP signal
to re-read the configuration file, and then find a syntax error in
this file, it will print an error message and then continue, ignoring
the contents of the (faulty) configuration file, as if the \fBHUP\fP
signal had never been received.
.PP
When \fBsmartd\fP is running in debug mode, the \fBINT\fP signal
(normally generated from a shell with CONTROL-C) is treated in the
same way as a \fBHUP\fP signal: it makes \fBsmartd\fP reload its
configuration file.
To exit \fBsmartd\fP use CONTROL-\e.
.\" %IF OS Windows
(Windows: CONTROL-Break).
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows
.\" %IF ENABLE_SYSTEMD_NOTIFY
.PP
[Linux only] If \fBsmartd\fP is started as a \fBsystemd\fP(1) service and
\*(AqType=Notify\*(Aq is specified in the service file, the service manager
is notified after successful startup.
Other state changes are reported via systemd notify STATUS messages.
Notification of successful reloads (after \fBHUP\fP signal) is not supported.
To detect this process start-up type, \fBsmartd\fP checks whether the
environment variable \*(AqNOTIFY_SOCKET\*(Aq is set.
Note that it is required to set the \*(Aq\-n\*(Aq (\*(Aq\-\-nofork\*(Aq)
option in the \*(AqExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/smartd\*(Aq command line
if \*(AqType=Notify\*(Aq is used.
.\" %ENDIF ENABLE_SYSTEMD_NOTIFY

On startup, in the absence of the configuration file
\fB/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\fP, the \fBsmartd\fP daemon first scans for all
devices that support SMART.  The scanning is done as follows:

attribute values) to files \*(AqPREFIX\*(Aq\*(AqMODEL\-SERIAL.ata.csv\*(Aq
or \*(AqPREFIX\*(Aq\*(AqVENDOR\-MODEL\-SERIAL.scsi.csv\*(Aq.
At each check cycle attributes are logged as a line of semicolon separated
triplets of the form "attribute-ID;attribute-norm-value;attribute-raw-value;".
For SCSI devices error counters and temperature recorded in the form
"counter-name;counter-value;".
Each line is led by a date string of the form "yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS"
(in local time).

If \*(Aq\-\*(Aq is specified as the argument, attribute log files are
disabled.
.Sp
.\" %ENDIF ENABLE_ATTRIBUTELOG
MODEL and SERIAL are build from drive identify information, invalid
characters are replaced by underline.
.Sp
If the PREFIX has the form \*(Aq/path/dir/\*(Aq (e.g.\&
\*(Aq/var/lib/smartd/\*(Aq), then files \*(AqMODEL\-SERIAL.ata.csv\*(Aq are
created in directory \*(Aq/path/dir\*(Aq.
If the PREFIX has the form \*(Aq/path/name\*(Aq (e.g.\&
\*(Aq/var/lib/misc/attrlog\-\*(Aq),
then files \*(AqnameMODEL\-SERIAL.ata.csv\*(Aq are created in directory
\*(Aq/path/\*(Aq.
The path must be absolute, except if debug mode is enabled.
.TP
.B \-B [+]FILE, \-\-drivedb=[+]FILE
[ATA only] Read the drive database from FILE.  The new database replaces
the built in database by default.  If \*(Aq+\*(Aq is specified, then the new
entries prepend the built in entries.
Please see the \fBsmartctl\fP(8) man page for further details.
.TP
.B \-c FILE, \-\-configfile=FILE
Read \fBsmartd\fP configuration Directives from FILE, instead of from
the default location \fB/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\fP
(Windows: \fBEXEDIR/smartd.conf\fP).
If FILE does \fBnot\fP exist, then \fBsmartd\fP will print an error
message and exit with nonzero status.
Thus, \*(Aq\-c /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\*(Aq can be used to verify the
existence of the default configuration file.
.Sp
By using \*(Aq\-\*(Aq for FILE, the configuration is read from standard input.
This is useful for commands like:
.br
.B echo /dev/sdb \-m user@home \-M test | smartd \-c \- \-q onecheck
.br
to perform quick and simple checks without a configuration file.
.\" %IF ENABLE_CAPABILITIES
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-capabilities[=mail]
[Linux only] Use libcap-ng to drop unneeded Linux process \fBcapabilities\fP(7).
The following capabilities are kept in the effective and permissive sets:
CAP_SYS_ADMIN, CAP_SYS_RAWIO, CAP_MKNOD.
If the \*(Aq\-u, \-\-warn_as_user\*(Aq option (see below) is used with a
non-privileged user or group, the following capabilities are also kept:
CAP_SETGID, CAP_SETUID.
The capability bounding set is cleared.
.Sp
[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD FEATURE]
Mail notification is no longer suppressed if capabilities are dropped.
It depends on the local MTA whether mail could be send from a root process
with all capabilities dropped.
It works with the \fBpostfix\fP MTA.
.Sp
If \*(Aq\-\-capabilities=mail\*(Aq is specified, the following
capabilities are added to the bounding set:
CAP_SETGID, CAP_SETUID, CAP_CHOWN, CAP_FOWNER, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE.
This allows one to send mail with the \fBexim\fP MTA.
.\" %ENDIF ENABLE_CAPABILITIES
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Runs \fBsmartd\fP in "debug" mode.  In this mode, it displays status
information to STDOUT rather than logging it to SYSLOG and does not
\fBfork\fP(2) into the background and detach from the controlling
terminal.  In this mode, \fBsmartd\fP also prints more verbose
information about what it is doing than when operating in "daemon"
mode.  In this mode, the \fBINT\fP signal (normally generated from a
terminal with CONTROL-C) makes \fBsmartd\fP reload its configuration
file.  Please use CONTROL-\e to exit
.\" %IF OS Windows
(Windows: CONTROL-Break).
.Sp
[Windows only] The "debug" mode can be toggled by the command
\fBsmartd sigusr2\fP.
A new console for debug output is opened when debug mode is enabled.
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-showdirectives
Prints a list (to STDOUT) of all the possible Directives which may
appear in the configuration file /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf, and then exits.
These Directives are described in the \fBsmartd.conf\fP(5) man page.
They may appear in the configuration file following the device name.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help, \-\-usage
Prints usage message to STDOUT and exits.
.TP
.B \-i N, \-\-interval=N
Sets the interval between disk checks to \fIN\fP seconds, where
\fIN\fP is a decimal integer.  The minimum allowed value is ten and
the maximum is the largest positive integer that can be represented on
your system (often 2^31\-1).  The default is 1800 seconds.
.br
[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD FEATURE]
The interval could be overridden with the \*(Aq\-c i=N\*(Aq directive,
see \fBsmartd.conf\fP(5) man page.
.Sp
Note that the superuser can make \fBsmartd\fP check the status of the
disks at any time by sending it the \fBSIGUSR1\fP signal, for example
with the command:
.br
.B kill \-SIGUSR1 <pid>
.br
where \fB<pid>\fP is the process id number of \fBsmartd\fP.  One may
also use:
.br
.B killall \-USR1 smartd
.br
for the same purpose.
.br
.\" %IF OS Windows
(Windows: See NOTES below.)
.\" %ENDIF OS Windows
.TP
.B \-l FACILITY, \-\-logfacility=FACILITY
Uses syslog facility FACILITY to log the messages from \fBsmartd\fP.
Here FACILITY is one of \fIlocal0\fP, \fIlocal1\fP, ..., \fIlocal7\fP,
or \fIdaemon\fP [default].  If this command-line option is not used,
then by default messages from \fBsmartd\fP are logged to the facility
\fIdaemon\fP.
.Sp
If you would like to have \fBsmartd\fP messages logged somewhere other
than the default location, include (for example) \*(Aq\-l local3\*(Aq in its
start up argument list.
Tell the syslog daemon to log all messages from facility \fBlocal3\fP
to (for example) \*(Aq/var/log/smartd.log\*(Aq.

.TP
.B \-p NAME, \-\-pidfile=NAME
Writes pidfile \fINAME\fP containing the \fBsmartd\fP Process ID
number (PID).  To avoid symlink attacks make sure the directory to
which pidfile is written is only writable for root.  Without this
option, or if the \-\-debug option is given, no PID file is written on
startup.  If \fBsmartd\fP is killed with a maskable signal then the
pidfile is removed.
.TP
.B \-q WHEN, \-\-quit=WHEN
Specifies when, if ever, \fBsmartd\fP should exit.  The valid
arguments are to this option are:
.Sp
.I nodev
\- Exit if there are no devices to monitor, or if any errors are found
at startup in the configuration file.
This is the default.
.Sp
.I errors
\- Exit if there are no devices to monitor, or if any errors are found
in the configuration file /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf at startup or whenever it
is reloaded.
.Sp
.I nodevstartup
\- Exit if there are no devices to monitor at startup.  But continue
to run if no devices are found whenever the configuration file is
reloaded.
.Sp
.I never
\- Only exit if a fatal error occurs (no remaining system memory,
invalid command line arguments).
In this mode, even if there are no devices to monitor, or if the configuration
file \fB/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf\fP has errors, \fBsmartd\fP will continue
to run, waiting to load a configuration file listing valid devices.
.Sp
.I nodev0
\- [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD FEATURE]
Same as \*(Aqnodev\*(Aq, except that the exit status is 0 if there are no
devices to monitor.
.Sp
.I nodev0startup
\- [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD FEATURE]
Same as \*(Aqnodevstartup\*(Aq, except that the exit status is 0 if there are no
devices to monitor.
.Sp
.I errors,nodev0
\- [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD FEATURE]
Same as \*(Aqerrors\*(Aq, except that the exit status is 0 if there are no
devices to monitor.
.Sp
.I onecheck
\- Start \fBsmartd\fP in debug mode, then register devices, then check
device's SMART status once, and then exit with zero exit status if all
of these steps worked correctly.
.Sp
This last option is intended for \*(Aqdistribution-writers\*(Aq who want to
create automated scripts to determine whether or not to automatically
start up \fBsmartd\fP after installing smartmontools.  After starting
\fBsmartd\fP with this command-line option, the distribution's install
scripts should wait a reasonable length of time (say ten seconds).  If
\fBsmartd\fP has not exited with zero status by that time, the script
should send \fBsmartd\fP a SIGTERM or SIGKILL and assume that
\fBsmartd\fP will not operate correctly on the host.  Conversely, if
\fBsmartd\fP exits with zero status, then it is safe to run
\fBsmartd\fP in normal daemon mode.  If \fBsmartd\fP is unable to
monitor any devices or encounters other problems then it will return
with non-zero exit status.
.Sp
.I showtests
\- Start \fBsmartd\fP in debug mode, then register devices, then write
a list of future scheduled self tests to stdout, and then exit with zero
exit status if all of these steps worked correctly.
Device's SMART status is not checked.
.Sp
This option is intended to test whether the \*(Aq\-s REGEX\*(Aq directives in
smartd.conf will have the desired effect.  The output lists the next test
schedules, limited to 5 tests per type and device.  This is followed by a
summary of all tests of each device within the next 90 days.
.TP
.B \-r TYPE, \-\-report=TYPE
Intended primarily to help
.B smartmontools
developers understand the behavior of
.B smartmontools
on non-conforming or poorly-conforming hardware.  This option reports
details of
\fBsmartd\fP
transactions with the device.  The option can be used multiple times.
When used just once, it shows a record of the ioctl() transactions
with the device.  When used more than once, the detail of these ioctl()
transactions are reported in greater detail.  The valid arguments to
this option are:
.Sp
.I ioctl
\- report all ioctl() transactions.
.Sp
.I ataioctl
\- report only ioctl() transactions with ATA devices.
.Sp
.I scsiioctl
\- report only ioctl() transactions with SCSI devices.

.\" %IF OS Darwin FreeBSD Linux NetBSD Windows Cygwin
.I nvmeioctl
\- report only ioctl() transactions with NVMe devices.
.Sp
.\" %ENDIF OS Darwin FreeBSD Linux NetBSD Windows Cygwin
Any argument may include a positive integer to specify the level of
detail that should be reported.  The argument should be followed by a
comma then the integer with no spaces.  For example, \fIataioctl,2\fP
The default level is 1, so \*(Aq\-r ataioctl,1\*(Aq and

Note that in this message, the value given is the \*(AqNormalized\*(Aq not the
\*(AqRaw\*(Aq Attribute value (the disk temperature in this case is about 22
Celsius).  The
.B \*(Aq\-R\*(Aq
and
.B \*(Aq\-r\*(Aq
Directives modify this behavior, so that the information is printed
with the Raw values as well, for example:
.br
.B \*(AqDevice: /dev/sda, SMART Attribute: 194 Temperature_Celsius changed from 94 [Raw 22] to 93 [Raw 23]\*(Aq
.br
Here the Raw values are the actual disk temperatures in Celsius.  The
way in which the Raw values are printed, and the names under which the
Attributes are reported, is governed by the various
.B \*(Aq\-v Num,Description\*(Aq
Directives described previously.
.PP
Please see the
.B smartctl
manual page for further explanation of the differences between
Normalized and Raw Attribute values.
.PP
\fBsmartd\fP
will make log entries at loglevel
.B LOG_CRIT
if a SMART Attribute has failed, for example:
.br
.B \*(AqDevice: /dev/sdc, Failed SMART Attribute: 5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct\*(Aq
.br
 This loglevel is used for reporting enabled by the
.B \*(Aq\-H\*(Aq, \-f\*(Aq, \*(Aq\-l\ selftest\*(Aq,
and
.B \*(Aq\-l\ error\*(Aq
Directives.  Entries reporting failure of SMART Prefailure Attributes
should not be ignored: they mean that the disk is failing.  Use the
.B smartctl
utility to investigate.
.\" %IF OS Solaris
.PP
Under Solaris with the default \fB/etc/syslog.conf\fP configuration,
messages below loglevel \fBLOG_NOTICE\fP will \fBnot\fP be recorded.
Hence all \fBsmartd\fP messages with loglevel \fBLOG_INFO\fP will be
lost.  If you want to use the existing daemon facility to log all
messages from \fBsmartd\fP, you should change \fB/etc/syslog.conf\fP
from:
.Vb 1
       ...;daemon.notice;...        /var/adm/messages
.Ve
to read:
.Vb 1
       ...;daemon.info;...          /var/adm/messages
.Ve
Alternatively, you can use a local facility to log messages: please
see the \fBsmartd\fP \*(Aq\-l\*(Aq command-line option described above.

The Cygwin Version of \fBsmartd\fP can be run as a service via the

.PP
On Windows, the log messages are written to the event log or to a file.
See documentation of the \*(Aq\-l FACILITY\*(Aq option above for details.
.PP
On Windows, the following built-in commands can be used to control
\fBsmartd\fP, if running as a daemon:
.PP
\*(Aq\fBsmartd status\fP\*(Aq \- check status
.br
\*(Aq\fBsmartd stop\fP\*(Aq \- stop smartd
.br
\*(Aq\fBsmartd reload\fP\*(Aq \- reread config file
.br
\*(Aq\fBsmartd restart\fP\*(Aq \- restart smartd
.br
\*(Aq\fBsmartd sigusr1\fP\*(Aq \- check disks now
.br
\*(Aq\fBsmartd sigusr2\fP\*(Aq \- toggle debug mode
.PP
The Windows Version of \fBsmartd\fP has buildin support for services:
.PP
\*(Aq\fBsmartd install [options]\fP\*(Aq installs a service
named "smartd" (display name "SmartD Service") using the command line
\*(Aq/INSTALLPATH/smartd.exe \-\-service [options]\*(Aq.
This also installs smartd.exe as a event message file for the Windows
event viewer.
.PP
This does not work if the option \*(Aq--warn-as-user=restricted\*(Aq is
specified because the local \*(AqSYSTEM\*(Aq account cannot be restricted.
The service must then be manually reconfigured to run as a another user
which is a member of the local \*(AqAdministrator\*(Aq group.
.PP
\*(Aq\fBsmartd remove\fP\*(Aq can later be used to remove the service and
event message entries from the registry.
.PP
Upon startup, the smartd service changes the working directory
to its own installation path.  If smartd.conf and blat.exe are stored
in this directory, no \*(Aq\-c\*(Aq option and \*(Aq\-M exec\*(Aq directive
is needed.
.PP
The debug mode (\*(Aq\-d\*(Aq, \*(Aq\-q onecheck\*(Aq) does not work if
smartd is running as service.
.PP
The service can be controlled as usual with Windows commands \*(Aqnet\*(Aq
or \*(Aqsc\*(Aq (\*(Aq\fBnet start smartd\fP\*(Aq,
\*(Aq\fBnet stop smartd\fP\*(Aq).
.PP
Pausing the service (\*(Aq\fBnet pause smartd\fP\*(Aq) sets the interval
between disk checks (\*(Aq\-i N\*(Aq) to infinite.
.PP
Continuing the paused service (\*(Aq\fBnet continue smartd\fP\*(Aq) resets the
interval and rereads the configuration file immediately (like \fBSIGHUP\fP).
The \*(AqPARAMCHANGE\*(Aq service control command (\*(Aq\fBsc control smartd
paramchange\fP\*(Aq) has the same effect regardless of paused state.
.PP
Continuing a still running service (\*(Aq\fBnet continue smartd\fP\*(Aq without
preceding \*(Aq\fBnet pause smartd\fP\*(Aq) does not reread configuration but
checks disks immediately (like \fBSIGUSR1\fP).

.SH LOG TIMESTAMP TIMEZONE
When \fBsmartd\fP makes log entries, these are time-stamped.  The time
stamps are in the computer's local time zone, which is generally set
using either the environment variable \*(Aq\fBTZ\fP\*(Aq or using a
time-zone file such as \fB/etc/localtime\fP.  You may wish to change
the timezone while \fBsmartd\fP is running (for example, if you carry
a laptop to a new time-zone and don't reboot it).  Due to a bug in the
\fBtzset\fP(3) function of many unix standard C libraries, the
time-zone stamps of \fBsmartd\fP might not change.  For some systems,
\fBsmartd\fP will work around this problem \fIif\fP the time-zone is
set using \fB/etc/localtime\fP.  The work-around \fIfails\fP if the
time-zone is set using the \*(Aq\fBTZ\fP\*(Aq variable (or a file that it
points to).
.Sp
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status (return value) of \fBsmartd\fP can have the following values:
.TP
.B 0:
Daemon startup successful, or \fBsmartd\fP was killed by a SIGTERM
(or in debug mode, a SIGQUIT).
.TP
.B 1:
Commandline did not parse.
.TP
.B 2:
There was a syntax error in the config file.
.TP
.B 3:
Forking the daemon failed.
.TP
.B 4:
Couldn't create PID file.
.TP
.B 5:
Config file does not exist (only returned in conjunction with the \*(Aq\-c\*(Aq
option).
.TP
.B 6:
Config file exists, but cannot be read.
.TP
.B 8:
\fBsmartd\fP
ran out of memory during startup.
.TP
.B 10:
An inconsistency was found in \fBsmartd\fP's internal data
structures.  This should never happen.  It must be due to either a
coding or compiler bug.  \fIPlease\fP report such failures to
smartmontools developers, see REPORTING BUGS below.
.TP
.B 16:
A device explicitly listed in
.B /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf
can't be monitored.
.TP
.B 17:
\fBsmartd\fP
didn't find any devices to monitor.
.br
[NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTD FEATURE]
This could be changed to \fB0\fP (success) with one of the
\*(Aq-q *nodev0*\*(Aq options, see above.
.TP
.B 254:
When in daemon mode,
\fBsmartd\fP
received a SIGINT or SIGQUIT.  (Note that in debug mode, SIGINT has
the same effect as SIGHUP, and makes \fBsmartd\fP reload its
configuration file.  SIGQUIT has the same effect as SIGTERM and causes
\fBsmartd\fP to exit with zero exit status.
.TP
.B 132 and above
\fBsmartd\fP
was killed by a signal that is not explicitly listed above.  The exit
status is then 128 plus the signal number.  For example if
\fBsmartd\fP
is killed by SIGKILL (signal 9) then the exit status is 137.

If you would like to understand better how SMART works, and what it
does, a good place to start is with Sections 4.8 and 6.54 of the first
volume of the \*(AqAT Attachment with Packet Interface-7\*(Aq (ATA/ATAPI-7)
specification Revision 4b.  This documents the SMART functionality which the
\fBsmartmontools\fP utilities provide access to.
.PP
The functioning of SMART was originally defined by the SFF-8035i
revision 2 and the SFF-8055i revision 1.4 specifications.  These are
publications of the Small Form Factors (SFF) Committee.
