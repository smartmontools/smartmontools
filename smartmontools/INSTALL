[1] System requirements
=======================

    A) Linux

    Any Linux distribution will support smartmontools if it has a
    kernel version greater than or equal to 2.2.14. So any recent
    Linux distribution should support smartmontools.

    There are two parts of smartmontools that may require a patched or
    nonstandard kernel:

    (1) To get the ATA RETURN SMART STATUS command, the kernel needs
    to support the HDIO_DRIVE_TASK ioctl().

    (2) To run Selective Self-tests, the kernel needs to support the
    HDIO_DRIVE_TASKFILE ioctl().

    If your kernel does not support one or both of these ioctls, then
    smartmontools will "mostly" work.  The things that don't work will
    give you harmless warning messages.

    For item (1) above, any 2.4 or 2.6 series kernel will provide
    HDIO_DRIVE_TASK support.  Some 2.2.20 and later kernels also
    provide this support IF they're properly patched and
    configured. [Andre Hedrick's IDE patches may be found at
    http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick/ide-2.2.20/
    or are available from your local kernel.org mirror.  They are not
    updated for 2.2.21 or later, and may contain a few bugs.].
    If the configuration option CONFIG_IDE_TASK_IOCTL
    exists in your 2.2.X kernel source code tree, then your 2.2.X
    kernel will probably support this ioctl. [Note that this kernel
    configuration option does NOT need to be enabled. Its presence
    merely indicates that the required HDIO_DRIVE_TASK ioctl() is
    supported.]

    For item (2) above, your kernel must be configured with the kernel
    configuration option CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO enabled.  This
    configuration option is present in all 2.4 and 2.6 series
    kernels. Some 2.2.20 and later kernels also provide this support
    IF they're properly patched and configured as described above.

    Please see FAQ section of the URL above for additional details.

    If you are using 3ware controllers, for full functionality you
    must either use version 1.02.00.037 or greater of the 3w-xxxx
    driver, or patch earlier 3ware 3w-xxxx drivers.  See
    http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/3w-xxxx.txt
    for the patch.  The version 1.02.00.037 3w-xxxx.c driver was
    incorporated into kernel 2.4.23-bk2 on 3 December 2003 and into
    kernel 2.6.0-test5-bk11 on 23 September 2003.

    B) FreeBSD

    For FreeBSD support, a 5-current kernel that includes ATAng is
    required in order to support ATA drives.  Even current versions of
    ATAng will not support 100% operation, as the SMART status can not
    be reliably retrieved.  There is patch pending approval of the
    ATAng driver maintainer that will address this issue.

    C) Solaris

    The SCSI code has been tested on a variety of Solaris 8 and 9
    systems.  ATA/IDE code only works on SPARC platform.  All tested
    kernels worked correctly.

    D) NetBSD/OpenBSD

    The code was tested on a 1.6ZG (i.e., 1.6-current) system. It should
    also function under 1.6.1 and later releases (unverified).  Currently
    it doesn't support ATA devices on 3ware RAID controllers.

    E) Cygwin

    The code was tested on Cygwin 1.7.15-1.  It should also work on other
    recent releases.

    Both Cygwin and Windows versions of smartmontools share the same code
    to access the IDE/ATA or SCSI devices. The information in the "Windows"
    section below also applies to the Cygwin version.

    F) Windows

    The code was tested on Windows XP SP3, 2003, Vista, Windows 7 and
    Windows 8 Release Preview.  Support von Windows 9x/ME and NT4 was removed
    after smartmontools 5.43.

    ATA or SATA devices are supported if the device driver implements
    the SMART IOCTLs or IOCTL_IDE_PASS_THROUGH or IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH.
    Only the latter provides full pass-through support which is needed
    for all smartmontools features.

    SCSI and USB devices are accessed through SPTI. Special driver support
    is not required.

    3ware 9000 RAID controllers are supported using features available
    in the Windows driver release 9.4.0 (3wareDrv.sys 3.0.2.70) or later.
    Older drivers provide SMART access to the first physical drive (port)
    of each logical drive (unit). If driver support is not available
    (7000/8000 series, 9000 on XP 64), smartctl can be used to parse SMART
    data output from CLI or 3DM.

    G) MacOS/Darwin

    The code was tested on MacOS 10.3.4.  It should work from 10.3
    forwards.  It doesn't support 10.2.

    It's important to know that on 10.3.x, some things don't work
    (see WARNINGS): due to bugs in the libraries used, you cannot run
    a short test or switch SMART support off on a drive; if you try,
    you will just run an extended test or switch SMART support on.  So
    don't panic when your "short" test seems to be taking hours.

    It's also not possible at present to control when the offline
    routine runs. If your drive doesn't have it running automatically by
    default, you can't run it at all.

    SCSI devices are not currently supported.  Detecting the power
    status of a drive is also not currently supported.

    To summarize this, from another point of view, the things that
    are not supported fall into two categories:

   * Can't be implemented easily without more kernel-level support,
     so far as I know:
     - running immediate offline, conveyance, or selective tests
     - running any test in captive mode
     - aborting tests
     - switching automatic offline testing on or off
     - support for SCSI
     - checking the power mode [-n Directive of smartd] (this is not
       completely impossible, but not by using a documented API)

   * Work on 10.4 and later, but not on 10.3:
     - switching off SMART (switching *on* works fine)
     - switching off auto-save (but why would you want to?)
     - running the short test (that leaves you with only the extended test)

    However, some things do work well.  For ATA devices, all the
    informational output is available, unless you want something that only
    an offline test updates.  On many newer Mac OS systems, the
    hard drive comes with the offline test switched on by default, so
    even that works.

    The OS X SAT SMART Driver provides access to SMART data for SAT capable
    USB and Firewire devices:
    https://github.com/kasbert/OS-X-SAT-SMART-Driver
    https://github.com/RJVB/OS-X-SAT-SMART-Driver
    This does not require any smartctl -d TYPE option and should work also
    with older smartmontools releases.

    H) OS/2, eComStation

    The code was tested on eComStation 1.1, but it should work on all versions
    of OS/2.
    Innotek LibC 0.5 runtime is required.
    Currently only ATA disks are supported, SCSI support will be added.

[2] Installing from SVN
=======================

    Get the sources from the SVN repository:
    svn co http://svn.code.sf.net/p/smartmontools/code/trunk/smartmontools smartmontools

    Then type:
    ./autogen.sh
    and continue with step [3] below, skipping the "unpack the tarball" step.

    The autogen.sh command is ONLY required when installing from
    SVN. You need GNU Autoconf (version 2.50 or greater), GNU Automake
    (version 1.7 or greater) and their dependencies installed in order
    to run it.  You can get these here:
    http://directory.fsf.org/project/autoconf/
    http://directory.fsf.org/project/automake/

[3] Installing from the source tarball
======================================

    If you are NOT installing from SVN, then unpack the tarball:
    tar zxvf smartmontools-5.VERSION.tar.gz

    Then:
    ./configure
    make
    make install (you may need to be root to do this)

    As shown (with no options to ./configure) this defaults to the
    following set of installation directories:
    --prefix=/usr/local
    --sbindir=/usr/local/sbin
    --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc
    --mandir=/usr/local/share/man
    --docdir=/usr/local/share/doc/smartmontools
    --with-exampledir=/usr/local/share/doc/smartmontools/examplescripts
    --with-drivedbdir=/usr/local/share/smartmontools
    --with-initscriptdir=auto
    --with-systemdsystemunitdir=auto
    --enable-drivedb
    --disable-attributelog
    --disable-sample
    --disable-savestates
    --with-libcap-ng=auto
    --without-selinux

    These will usually not overwrite existing "distribution" installations on
    Linux Systems since the FHS reserves this area for use by the system
    administrator.

    For different installation locations or distributions, simply add
    arguments to ./configure as shown in [4] below.

    If you wish to alter the default C++ compiler flags, set an
    environment variable CXXFLAGS='your options' before doing
    ./configure, or else do:
    make CXXFLAGS='your options'

    The first output line of smartctl and smartd provides information
    about release number, last SVN checkin date and revison, platform,
    and package. The latter defaults to "(local build)" and can be
    changed by the variable BUILD_INFO, for example:
    make BUILD_INFO='"(Debian 5.39-2)"'

[4] Guidelines for different Linux distributions
================================================

Note: Please send corrections/additions to:
smartmontools-support@lists.sourceforge.net

Debian:
  If you don't want to overwrite any distribution package, use:
  ./configure

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS, http://www.pathname.com/fhs/):
  ./configure --sbindir=/usr/local/sbin                               \
              --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc                             \
              --mandir=/usr/local/man                                 \
              --docdir=/usr/local/share/doc/smartmontools             \
              --with-initscriptdir=/usr/local/etc/init.d

Red Hat:
  ./configure --sbindir=/usr/sbin                               \
              --sysconfdir=/etc                                 \
              --mandir=/usr/share/man                           \
              --docdir=/usr/share/doc/smartmontools             \
              --with-initscriptdir=/etc/rc.d/init.d

Slackware:
  If you don't want to overwrite any "distribution" package, use:
  ./configure

  Otherwise use:
  ./configure --sbindir=/usr/sbin                               \
              --sysconfdir=/etc                                 \
              --mandir=/usr/share/man                           \
              --docdir=/usr/share/doc/smartmontools             \
              --with-initscriptdir=/etc/rc.d

  And
  removepkg smartmontools smartsuite (only root can do this)
  before make install

  The init script works on Slackware. You just have to add an entry like
  the following in /etc/rc.d/rc.M or /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/smartd ]; then
    . /etc/rc.d/smartd start
  fi

  To disable it:
  chmod 644 /etc/rc.d/smartd

  For a list of options:
  /etc/rc.d/smartd

SuSE:
  ./configure --sbindir=/usr/sbin                                        \
              --sysconfdir=/etc                                          \
              --mandir=/usr/share/man                                    \
              --docdir=/usr/share/doc/packages/smartmontools-VERSION     \
              --with-initscriptdir=/etc/init.d                           \

[5] Guidelines for FreeBSD
==========================
  To match the way it will installed when it becomes available as a PORT, use
  the following:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local                                      \
              --docdir=/usr/local/share/doc/smartmontools-VERSION      \
              --with-initscriptdir=/usr/local/etc/rc.d/                \
              --enable-sample

  NOTE: --enable-sample will cause the smartd.conf and smartd RC files to
  be installed with the string '.sample' append to the name, so you will end
  up with the following:
        /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf.sample
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/smartd.sample


[6] Guidelines for Darwin
=========================
  ./configure --with-initscriptdir=/Library/StartupItems

  If you'd like to build the i386 version on a powerpc machine, you can
  use

  CXX='g++ -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386' \
    ./configure --host=i386-apple-darwin \
                --with-initscriptdir=/Library/StartupItems

[7] Guidelines for NetBSD
=========================
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg                                       \
              --docdir=/usr/pkg/share/doc/smartmontools

[8] Guidelines for Solaris
==========================

    smartmontools has been partially but not completely ported to
    Solaris.  It includes complete SCSI support but no ATA or 3ware
    support.  It can be compiled with either CC (Sun's C++ compiler)
    or GNU g++.

    To compile with g++:

    ./configure [args]
    make

    To compile with Sun CC:

    env CC=cc CXX=CC ./configure [args]
    make

    The correct arguments [args] to configure are:
     --sbindir=/usr/sbin                                \
     --sysconfdir=/etc                                  \
     --mandir=/usr/share/man                            \
     --docdir=/usr/share/doc/smartmontools-VERSION      \
     --with-initscriptdir=/etc/init.d

    To start the script automatically on bootup, create hardlinks that
    indicate when to start/stop in:
                    /etc/rc[S0123].d/
    pointing to /etc/init.d/smartd. Create:
            K<knum>smartd in rcS.d, rc0.d, rc1.d, rc2.d
            S<snum>smartd in rc3.d
    where <knum> is related to <snum> such that the higher snum is the
    lower knum must be.

    On usual configuration, '95' would be suitable for <snum> and '05'
    for <knum> respectively.  If you choose these value, you can
    create hardlinks by:

    cd /etc
    sh -c 'for n in S 0 1 2; do ln init.d/smartd rc$n.d/K05smartd; done'
    sh -c 'for n in 3      ; do ln init.d/smartd rc$n.d/S95smartd; done'

[9] Guidelines for Cygwin
=========================

Same as Red Hat:
  ./configure --prefix=/usr                 \
              --sysconfdir=/etc             \
              --mandir='${prefix}/share/man'

  OR EQUIVALENTLY
  ./configure --sbindir=/usr/sbin                               \
              --sysconfdir=/etc                                 \
              --mandir=/usr/share/man                           \
              --docdir=/usr/share/doc/smartmontools             \
              --with-initscriptdir=/etc/rc.d/init.d

  Using DOS text file type as default for the working directories ("textmode"
  mount option) is not recommended. Building the binaries and man pages using
  "make" is possible, but "make dist" and related targets work only with UNIX
  file type ("binmode" mount option) set. The "autogen.sh" script prints a
  warning if DOS type is selected.

  Files may also be checked out with a non-Cygwin SVN client which uses CR/LF
  for svn:eol-style=native.  The "autogen.sh" script has svn:eol-style=LF.
  Bash option "-o igncr" is not required.

[10] Guidelines for Windows
===========================

To compile the Windows release with MinGW gcc on MSYS, use:

  ./configure
  make

  Instead of using "make install", copy the .exe files into
  some directory in the PATH.

Cross-compile statically linked 32-bit version with MinGW-w64:

  ./configure --build=$(./config.guess) \
              --host=i686-w64-mingw32 \
              LDFLAGS=-static

  Tested on Cygwin and Debian Linux.

Cross-compile statically linked 64-bit version with MinGW-w64:

  ./configure --build=$(./config.guess) \
              --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 \
              LDFLAGS=-static

  Tested on Cygwin and Debian Linux with MinGW-w64 from
  http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/.

Cross-compile on Cygwin with old gcc-mingw 3.x:

  ./configure --build=$(./config.guess) \
              --host=i686-pc-mingw32 \
               CC='gcc-3 -mno-cygwin' \
              CXX='g++-3 -mno-cygwin' \
              CXXFLAGS='-g -O2 -Wall -W -Wno-format'

Cross-compile on Debian Linux with gcc-mingw32:

  ./configure --build=$(./config.guess) \
              --host=i586-mingw32msvc


To build the Windows binary distribution, use:

  make dist-win32

  This builds the distribution in directory

  ./smartmontools-VERSION.win32/

  and packs it into

  ./smartmontools-VERSION.win32.zip

To create a Windows installer, use:

  make installer-win32

  This builds the distribution directory and packs it into the
  self-extracting install program

  ./smartmontools-VERSION.win32-setup.exe

  The installer is build using the command "makensis" from the NSIS
  package. See http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ for documentation and
  download location.

  It is also possible to (cross-)build the installer on Linux.
  This was successfully tested on Debian with package "nsis".

To create a combined 32-/64-bit installer, use this in 32-bit build
directory if 64-build directory is at ../build64:

  make builddir_win64=../build64 installer_win32

To both create and run the (interactive) installer, use:

  make install-win32

  Additional make targets are distdir-win32 to build the directory
  only and cleandist-win32 for cleanup.

  The binary distribution includes all documentation files converted
  to DOS text file format and *.html and *.txt preformatted man pages.
  The tools unix2dos.exe (package cygutils) and zip.exe (package zip
  or a native Win32 release of Info-ZIP, http://www.info-zip.org) are
  necessary but may be not installed by Cygwin's default settings.

  The event message file tool syslogevt.exe (see smartd man page) is
  included in the binary distribution if message compiler (windmc)
  and resource compiler (windres) are available. This may be disabled
  by passing 'WINDMC=no' to configure.

To prepare os_win32 directory for MS Visual Studio C++ 2010 [Express],
use the following on MSYS or Cygwin:

  mkdir vctmp && cd vctmp
  ../configure [... any MinGW option set from above ...]
  make config-vc10

  The MSVC project files (os_win32/vc10/*) are included in SVN (but not
  in source tarball). The target config-vc10 from a Makefile configured
  for MinGW creates os_win32/vc10/{config,svnversion}.h from
  ./{config,svnversion}.h. The configure skript must be run outside
  of the source directory to avoid inclusion of the original config.h.


[11] Guidelines for OS/2, eComStation
=====================================

To compile the OS/2 code, please run

  ./os_os2/configure.os2
  make
  make install

[12] Guidelines for OpenBSD
===========================
  To match the way it will installed when it becomes available as a PORT, use
  the following:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local                                      \
              --sysconfdir=/etc                                        \
              --docdir=/usr/local/share/doc/smartmontools-VERSION      \
              --without-initscriptdir                                  \
              --enable-sample

  NOTE: --enable-sample will cause the smartd.conf and smartd RC files to
  be installed with the string '.sample' append to the name, so you will end
  up with the following:
        /etc/smartd.conf.sample

[13] Comments
============

To compile from another directory, you can replace the step
  ./configure [options]
by the following:
  mkdir objdir
  cd objdir
  ../configure [options]

Man pages contents is platform-specific by default. Info specific to other
platforms may be not visible. To generate man pages with full contents use:

  make os_man_filter=

To install to another destination (used mainly by package maintainers,
or to examine the package contents without risk of modifying any
system files) you can replace the step:
  make install
with:
  make DESTDIR=/home/myself/smartmontools-package install

Use a full path. Paths like ./smartmontools-package may not work.

After installing smartmontools, you can read the man pages, and try
out the commands:
   
man smartd.conf
man smartctl
man smartd

/usr/sbin/smartctl -s on -o on -S on /dev/hda (only root can do this)
/usr/sbin/smartctl -a /dev/hda (only root can do this)

Note that the default location for the manual pages are
/usr/share/man/man5 and /usr/share/man/man8.  If "man" doesn't find
them, you may need to add /usr/share/man to your MANPATH environment
variable.

Source and binary packages for Windows are available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartmontools/files/

Refer to http://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Download for any additional
download and installation instructions.

The following files are installed if ./configure has no options:

If /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf exists and differs from the
default then the default configuration file is installed as
/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf.sample instead.

The commands:

make htmlman
make txtman

may be used to build .html and .txt preformatted man pages.
These are used by the dist-win32 make target to build the Windows
distribution.
The commands also work on other operating system configurations
if suitable versions of man2html, groff and grotty are installed.
On systems without man2html, the following command should work
if groff is available:

make MAN2HTML='groff -man -Thtml' htmlman


Some of the source files are prepared for the documentation
generator Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/). If Doxygen is installed,
the command:

doxygen

creates HTML documentation in doc/html and LaTeX documentation
in doc/latex. If TeX is installed, the following command creates
a documentation file doc/latex/refman.pdf:

( cd doc/latex && make pdf )


[14] Detailed description of arguments to configure command
===========================================================

When you type:
./configure [options]
there are six particularly important variables that affect where the
smartmontools software is installed.  The variables are listed here,
with their default values in square brackets, and the quantities that
they affect described following that.  This is a very wide table: please read
it in a wide window.

OPTIONS              DEFAULT                                      AFFECTS
-------              -------                                      -------

                                                                  (autoconf >= 2.60 only, see also --with-docdir below)
--mandir             ${prefix}/share/man                          Directory for smartctl/smartd/smartd.conf man pages
--sysconfdir         ${prefix}/etc                                Directory for smartd.conf;
                                                                  Contents of smartd executable;
                                                                  Contents of smartd/smartd.conf man pages;
                                                                  Directory for rc.d/init.d/smartd init script
--with-initscriptdir           auto                               Location of init scripts
--with-systemdsystemunitdir    auto                               Location of systemd service files
--with-systemdenvfile ${sysconfdir}/sysconfig/smartmontools       Path of environment file for system service
--with-docdir         ${prefix}/share/doc/smartmontools           Location of the documentation
--with-exampledir     ${docdir}/examplescripts                    Location of example scripts
--enable-sample       --disable-sample                            Adds the string '.sample' to the names of the smartd.conf file and the smartd RC file
--with-os-deps        os_<guessed>.o                              OS dependent module(s)
--with-selinux        --without-selinux                           Enables SELinux support.  If smartmontools has to create the /dev/tw[ae] device
                                                                  nodes for 3ware/AMCC controllers, this option ensures that the nodes are created
                                                                  with correct SELinux file contexts.
--with-libcap-ng      --with-libcap-ng=auto                       Enables/disables libcap-ng support. If enabled and libcap-ng is
                                                                  available, option --capabilities is added to smartd.
--disable-drivedb     --enable-drivedb                            Disables default drive database file '${drivedbdir}/drivedb.h'
--with-drivedbdir     ${prefix}/share/smartmontools               Directory for 'drivedb.h' (implies --enable-drivedb)
--with-smartdscriptdir    ${sysconfdir}                           Directory for 'smartd_warning.sh' script
--with-smartdplugindir    ${sysconfdir}/smartd_warning.d          Directory for 'smartd_warning.sh' plugin scripts
--enable-savestates   --disable-savestates                        Enables default smartd state files '${savestates}MODEL-SERIAL.ata.state'
--with-savestates     ${prefix}/var/lib/smartmontools/smartd.     Prefix for smartd state files (implies --enable-savestates)
--enable-attributelog --disable-attributelog                      Enables default smartd attribute log files
--with-attributelog   ${prefix}/var/lib/smartmontools/attrlog.    Prefix for smartd attribute log files (implies --enable-attributelog)
--with-working-snprintf    MinGW:guessed,others:yes               Function snprintf() handles output truncation as specified by C99

Please note that in previous versions of smartmontools (<= 5.39) the
default for --with-docdir was
  ${prefix}/share/doc/smartmontools-VERSION
This was changed to make it consistent with the default of the
new --docdir option added in autoconf 2.60.

The defaults for --with-initscriptdir and --with-systemdsystemunitdir are
guessed such that the following rules apply:
- If --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc is specified, the guessed directories
  should be the defaults used by the current OS or distribution.
- If --sysconfdir=/etc is NOT specified, the guessed directories should
  always be below ${prefix} or below ${sysconfdir}.

Here's an example:
If you set --prefix=/home/joe and none of the other four
variables then the different directories that are used would be:
--sbindir             /home/joe/sbin
--docdir              /home/joe/share/doc/smartmontools
--mandir              /home/joe/share/man
--sysconfdir          /home/joe/etc
--with-exampledir     /home/joe/share/doc/smartmontools/examplescripts
--with-drivedbdir     /home/joe/share/smartmontools
--with-initscriptdir         [see below]
--with-systemdsystemunitdir  [see below]

If systemd is present (and pkg-config reports /lib/systemd/system
as the systemdsystemunitdir):

--with-initscriptdir         [disabled]
--with-systemdsystemunitdir  /home/joe/lib/systemd/system

else if /etc/rc.d/init.d exists:

--with-initscriptdir         /home/joe/etc/rc.d/init.d
--with-systemdsystemunitdir  [disabled]

else if /etc/init.d exists:

--with-initscriptdir         /home/joe/etc/init.d
--with-systemdsystemunitdir  [disabled]

else if /etc/rc.d exists:

--with-initscriptdir         /home/joe/etc/rc.d
--with-systemdsystemunitdir  [disabled]

else

--with-initscriptdir         [disabled]
--with-systemdsystemunitdir  [disabled]

This is useful for test installs in a harmless subdirectory somewhere.

Here are the four possible cases for the four variables above:

Case 1:
--prefix not set
--variable not set
===> VARIABLE gets default value above

Case 2:
--prefix set
--variable not set
===> VARIABLE gets PREFIX/ prepended to default value above

Case 3:
--prefix not set
--variable set
===> VARIABLE gets value that is set

Case 4:
--prefix is set
--variable is set
===> PREFIX is IGNORED, VARIABLE gets value that is set


Here are the differences with and without --enable-sample, assuming
that initscript location is set and no other options specified 
(see above for details)

Case 1:
--enable-sample provided
==> Files installed are:
        /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf.sample
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd.sample

Case 2:
--disable-sample provided or parameter left out
==> Files installed are:
        /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/init.d/smartd
