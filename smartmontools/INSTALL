[1] System requirements
=======================

    Note: Some of this info is outdated as it refers to very old OS
    versions.

    A) Linux

    Any Linux distribution will support smartmontools if it has a
    kernel version greater than or equal to 2.2.14. So any recent
    Linux distribution should support smartmontools.

    B) FreeBSD

    For FreeBSD support, a 5-current kernel that includes ATAng is
    required in order to support ATA drives.  Even current versions of
    ATAng will not support 100% operation, as the SMART status can not
    be reliably retrieved.  There is patch pending approval of the
    ATAng driver maintainer that will address this issue.

    C) Solaris

    The SCSI code has been tested on a variety of Solaris 8 or later
    systems.  ATA/IDE code only works on SPARC platform.  All tested
    kernels worked correctly.

    D) NetBSD/OpenBSD

    The code was tested on a 1.6ZG (i.e., 1.6-current) system. It should
    also function under 1.6.1 and later releases.

    E) Cygwin

    The code was tested on Cygwin 2.11.* x86 and x86_64.  It should also
    work on other recent releases.

    Both Cygwin and Windows versions of smartmontools share the same code
    to access the raw devices.  The information in the "Windows" section
    below also applies to the Cygwin version.

    F) Windows

    The code was tested on Windows XP SP3, 2003, Vista, Windows 7, 8, 8.1
    and Windows 10 up to 1809.  Support von Windows 9x/ME and NT4 was
    removed after smartmontools 5.43.

    ATA or SATA devices are supported if the device driver implements
    the SMART IOCTLs or IOCTL_IDE_PASS_THROUGH or IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH.
    Only the latter provides full pass-through support which is needed
    for all smartmontools features.

    SATA devices behind a Intel RST driver are accessed through CSMI.

    SCSI and USB devices are accessed through SPTI. Special driver support
    is not required.

    NVMe devices are supported with the Windows 10 NVMe driver or with
    vendor specific drivers supporting NVME_PASS_THROUGH.

    G) MacOS/Darwin

    The code was tested on MacOS 10.3.4.  It should work from 10.3
    forwards.  It doesn't support 10.2.

    Only basic SMART commands are supported for ATA devices.

    It's important to know that on 10.3.x, some things don't work
    due to bugs in the libraries used, you cannot run
    a short test or switch SMART support off on a drive; if you try,
    you will just run an extended test or switch SMART support on.  So
    don't panic when your "short" test seems to be taking hours.

    It's also not possible at present to control when the offline
    routine runs. If your drive doesn't have it running automatically by
    default, you can't run it at all.

    SCSI devices are not currently supported.

    The OS X SAT SMART Driver provides access to SMART data for SAT capable
    USB and Firewire devices:
    https://github.com/kasbert/OS-X-SAT-SMART-Driver
    https://github.com/RJVB/OS-X-SAT-SMART-Driver
    This does not require any smartctl -d TYPE option and should work also
    with older smartmontools releases.

    H) OS/2, eComStation

    The code was tested on eComStation 1.1, but it should work on all versions
    of OS/2.
    Innotek LibC 0.5 runtime is required.
    Only ATA disks are supported.

[2] Installing from SVN
=======================

    Get the sources from the SVN repository:
    svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/smartmontools/code/trunk/smartmontools smartmontools

    Then type:
    cd smartmontools
    ./autogen.sh
    and continue with step [3] below, skipping the "unpack the tarball" step.

    The autogen.sh command is ONLY required when installing from
    SVN. You need GNU Autoconf (version 2.60 or greater), GNU Automake
    (version 1.10 or greater) and their dependencies installed in order
    to run it.

[3] Installing from the source tarball
======================================

    If you are NOT installing from SVN, then unpack the tarball:
    tar xvf smartmontools-VERSION.tar.gz

    Then:
    ./configure
    make
    make install (you may need to be root to do this)

    As shown (with no options to ./configure) this defaults to the
    following set of installation directories and other settings:

    --prefix=/usr/local
    --exec-prefix='${prefix}'
    --sbindir='${exec_prefix}/sbin'
    --sysconfdir='${prefix}/etc'
    --localstatedir='${prefix}/var'
    --datarootdir='${prefix}/share'
    --datadir='${datarootdir}'
    --mandir='${datarootdir}/man'
    --docdir='${datarootdir}/doc/smartmontools'
    --disable-sample
    --disable-scsi-cdb-check
    --enable-fast-lebe
    --without-initscriptdir
    --with-exampledir='${docdir}/examplescripts'
    --with-drivedbdir='${datadir}/smartmontools'
    --with-update-smart-drivedb
    --with-gnupg
    --with-smartdscriptdir='${sysconfdir}'
    --with-smartdplugindir='${smartdscriptdir}/smartd_warning.d'
    --with-scriptpath='/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin'
    --without-savestates
    --without-attributelog
    --with-os-deps='os_linux.o dev_areca.o' (platform specific)
    --without-selinux
    --with-libcap-ng=auto
    --with-libsystemd=auto
    --with-systemdsystemunitdir=auto
    --with-systemdenvfile=auto
    --with-nvme-devicescan (Linux, Windows: yes; Others: no)
    --without-solaris-sparc-ata (Solaris SPARC only)
    --with-signal-func=sigaction
    --with-working-snprintf
    --with-mingw-aslr=auto (Windows only)
    --with-cxx11-option=auto
    --without-cxx11-regex

    These will usually not overwrite existing "distribution" installations on
    Linux Systems since the FHS reserves this area for use by the system
    administrator.

    For different installation locations or distributions, simply add
    arguments to ./configure as shown in [4] below.

    The first output line of smartctl and smartd provides information
    about release number, last SVN checkin date and revision, platform,
    and package. The latter defaults to "(local build)" and can be
    changed by the variable BUILD_INFO, for example:
    make BUILD_INFO='"(Debian 5.39-2)"'

[4] Guidelines for different Linux distributions
================================================

Note: Please send corrections/additions to:
smartmontools-support@listi.jpberlin.de

Red Hat:
  ./configure --sbindir=/usr/sbin                               \
              --sysconfdir=/etc                                 \
              --mandir=/usr/share/man                           \
              --docdir=/usr/share/doc/smartmontools             \
              --with-initscriptdir=/etc/rc.d/init.d

Slackware:
  If you don't want to overwrite any "distribution" package, use:
  ./configure

  Otherwise use:
  ./configure --sbindir=/usr/sbin                               \
              --sysconfdir=/etc                                 \
              --mandir=/usr/share/man                           \
              --docdir=/usr/share/doc/smartmontools             \
              --with-initscriptdir=/etc/rc.d

  And
  removepkg smartmontools smartsuite (only root can do this)
  before make install

  The init script works on Slackware. You just have to add an entry like
  the following in /etc/rc.d/rc.M or /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/smartd ]; then
    . /etc/rc.d/smartd start
  fi

  To disable it:
  chmod 644 /etc/rc.d/smartd

  For a list of options:
  /etc/rc.d/smartd

SuSE:
  ./configure --sbindir=/usr/sbin                                        \
              --sysconfdir=/etc                                          \
              --mandir=/usr/share/man                                    \
              --docdir=/usr/share/doc/packages/smartmontools-VERSION     \
              --with-initscriptdir=/etc/init.d                           \

[5] Guidelines for FreeBSD
==========================
  To match the way it will installed when it becomes available as a PORT, use
  the following:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local                                      \
              --docdir=/usr/local/share/doc/smartmontools-VERSION      \
              --with-initscriptdir=/usr/local/etc/rc.d/                \
              --enable-sample

  NOTE: --enable-sample will cause the smartd.conf and smartd RC files to
  be installed with the string '.sample' append to the name, so you will end
  up with the following:
        /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf.sample
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/smartd.sample


[6] Guidelines for Darwin
=========================

  ./configure --with-initscriptdir=/Library/StartupItems

  If you'd like to build the i386 version on a powerpc machine, you can
  use

  CXX='g++ -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386' \
    ./configure --host=i386-apple-darwin \
                --with-initscriptdir=/Library/StartupItems

[7] Guidelines for NetBSD
=========================

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg                                       \
              --docdir=/usr/pkg/share/doc/smartmontools

[8] Guidelines for Solaris
==========================

    smartmontools has been partially but not completely ported to
    Solaris.  It includes complete SCSI support but no ATA or NVMe
    support.  It can be compiled with either CC (Sun's C++ compiler)
    or GNU g++.

    To compile with g++:

    ./configure [args]
    make

    To compile with Sun CC:

    env CC=cc CXX=CC ./configure [args]
    make

    The correct arguments [args] to configure are:
     --sbindir=/usr/sbin                                \
     --sysconfdir=/etc                                  \
     --mandir=/usr/share/man                            \
     --docdir=/usr/share/doc/smartmontools-VERSION      \
     --with-initscriptdir=/etc/init.d

[9] Guidelines for Cygwin
=========================

  ./configure --prefix=/usr                 \
              --sysconfdir=/etc             \
              --with-initscriptdir=/etc/rc.d/init.d

[10] Guidelines for Windows
===========================

To compile statically linked Windows release with MinGW gcc on MSYS, use:

  ./configure
  make

  Instead of using "make install", copy the .exe files into
  some directory in the PATH.

Cross-compile statically linked 32-bit and 64-bit versions with MinGW-w64:

  ./configure --build=$(./config.guess) \
              --host=i686-w64-mingw32

  ./configure --build=$(./config.guess) \
              --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32

  Tested on Cygwin, Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu.


To create the Windows installer, use:

  make installer-win32

  This builds the distribution directory and packs it into the
  self-extracting install program

  ./smartmontools-VERSION.win32-setup.exe

  The installer is build using the command "makensis" from the NSIS
  package (https://nsis.sourceforge.net/).

To create a combined 32-/64-bit installer, use this in 32-bit build
directory if 64-build directory is at ../build64:

  make builddir_win64=../build64 installer_win32

To both create and run the (interactive) installer, use:

  make install-win32

  Additional make targets are distdir-win32 to build the directory
  only and cleandist-win32 for cleanup.

  The binary distribution includes all documentation files converted
  to DOS text file format and *.html and *.pdf preformatted man pages.

To prepare os_win32/vc14 directory for MS Visual Studio C++ 2015 builds,
use the following on MSYS or Cygwin:

  mkdir vctmp && cd vctmp
  ../configure [... any MinGW option set from above ...]
  make config-vc14

  The MSVC project files (os_win32/vc14/*) are included in SVN (but not
  in source tarball). The target config-vc14 from a Makefile configured
  for MinGW creates os_win32/vc14/{config.h,smart*.rc,svnversion.h}.
  The configure script must be run outside of the source directory to
  avoid inclusion of the original config.h.
  Additional MSVC related make targets are clean-vc14, distclean-vc14
  and maintainer-clean-vc14.


[11] Guidelines for OS/2, eComStation
=====================================

To compile the OS/2 code, please run

  ./configure
  make
  make install

[12] Guidelines for OpenBSD
===========================

  To match the way it will installed when it becomes available as a PORT, use
  the following:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local                                      \
              --sysconfdir=/etc                                        \
              --docdir=/usr/local/share/doc/smartmontools-VERSION      \
              --enable-sample

  NOTE: --enable-sample will cause the smartd.conf and smartd RC files to
  be installed with the string '.sample' append to the name, so you will end
  up with the following:
        /etc/smartd.conf.sample

[13] Comments
============

To compile from another directory, you can replace the step
  ./configure [options]
by the following:
  mkdir objdir
  cd objdir
  ../configure [options]

Man pages contents is platform-specific by default. Info specific to other
platforms may be not visible. To generate man pages with full contents use:

  make os_man_filter=

To install to another destination (used mainly by package maintainers,
or to examine the package contents without risk of modifying any
system files) you can replace the step:
  make install
with:
  make DESTDIR=/home/myself/smartmontools-package install

Use a full path. Paths like ./smartmontools-package may not work.

After installing smartmontools, you can read the man pages, and try
out the commands:
   
man smartd.conf
man smartctl
man smartd

sudo /usr/sbin/smartctl -x /dev/sda

Source and binary packages for Windows are available at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/smartmontools/files/

Refer to https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Download for any additional
download and installation instructions.

The following files are installed if ./configure has no options:

/usr/local/sbin/smartctl                                [Executable command-line utility]
/usr/local/sbin/smartd                                  [Executable daemon]

/usr/local/share/smartmontools/drivedb.h                [Drive database]

Due to checks done by '--with-systemdsystemunitdir=auto', the following file may also be installed:

/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/smartd.service            [Systemd service file for smartd]

If /usr/local/etc/smartd.conf exists and differs from the
default then the default configuration file is installed as
/usr/local/etc/smartd.conf.sample instead.

The commands:

make htmlman
make pdfman
make txtman

may be used to build .html, .pdf and .txt preformatted man pages.
These are used by the dist-win32 make target to build the Windows
distribution.
The commands also work on other operating system configurations
if suitable versions of man, man2html and groff are installed.
On systems without man2html, the following command should work
if groff is available:

make MAN2HTML='groff -man -Thtml' htmlman


[14] Detailed description of arguments to configure command
===========================================================

When you type:
./configure --help
a description of available configure options is printed
[with defaults in square brackets].  See also section [3] above.


The following old configure options are no longer supported:

Old option                 Replacement
--with-docdir=DIR          --docdir=DIR (autoconf >= 2.60)
--enable-drivedb           [no option needed]
--disable-drivedb          --without-drivedbdir
--enable-savestates        --with-savestates[=yes]
--disable-savestates       [no option needed]
--enable-attrbutelog       --with-attributelog[=yes]
--disable-savestates       [no option needed]
--with-initscriptdir[=yes] --with-initscriptdir=DIR
--with-initscriptdir=auto  --with-initscriptdir=DIR


Here's an example:
If you set --prefix=/home/joe and none of the other four
variables then the different directories that are used would be:
--sbindir             /home/joe/sbin
--docdir              /home/joe/share/doc/smartmontools
--mandir              /home/joe/share/man
--sysconfdir          /home/joe/etc
--with-exampledir     /home/joe/share/doc/smartmontools/examplescripts
--with-drivedbdir     /home/joe/share/smartmontools
--with-initscriptdir         [disabled]
--with-systemdsystemunitdir  [see below]

If systemd is present (and pkg-config reports /lib/systemd/system
as the systemdsystemunitdir):

--with-systemdsystemunitdir  /home/joe/lib/systemd/system

else

--with-systemdsystemunitdir  [disabled]
