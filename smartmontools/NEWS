Summary: smartmontools release 5.36 (STABLE)
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is a stable smartmontools release.  The 5.34 version

Please report sucess/failure with these items to the
smartmontools-support mailing list.


Date 2004-7-5
Summary: smartmontools release 5.32 (STABLE)
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is an stable release of smartmontools.
Note added 2004/7/7: users building a Solaris/Intel version of the code should 
modify the 'configure' file, changing "pc-*-solaris*" on line 106
to read "*-pc-solaris*".  Reference:
http://smartmontools.cvs.sourceforge.net/smartmontools/sm5/configure.in?r1=1.83&r2=1.84


Date: 2004-5-4
Summary: smartmontools release 5.31 (UNSTABLE/EXPERIMENTAL)
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is an unstable/experimental release of smartmontools.  It includes
several new features:
- Windows smartd daemon
- smartd now monitors current and pending sector counts
- Support for ATA-7 selective self-test features (Linux/NetBSD only)
  Please report sucess/failure with this option to the smartmontools-support
  mailing list.

Date: 2004-3-6
Summary: smartmontools release 5.30 (STABLE)
--------------------------------------------
This is a stable release of smartmontools: the first stable release
since 5.26.
- KNOWN BUG (identified/fixed by CF): smartd will segv and crash if
  the configuration file /etc/smartd.conf contains NO valid entries.
  This bug was introduced in version 1.259 of smartd.c by BA and
  is present in smartmontools releases 5.27-5.30 inclusive. This can
  be fixed by editing line 3165 of smartd.c, and changing:
  "else if (cfgentries[0]) {"
  to read:
  "else if (cfgentries && cfgentries[0]) {"


Date: 2004-2-24
Summary: smartmontools release 5.29 (Experimental, not STABLE)
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is another experimental release, to replace the 5.27 release that
had a damaged configure script.  The next stable release will be 5.30
- This release has SCSI support for NetBSD


Date: 2004-2-12 
Summary: smartmontools release 5.27 (Experimental, not STABLE)
--------------------------------------------------------------
- WARNING: this release has a broken --prefix=/a/path option to the
  configure script.  The consequence is that smartd will not look for the
  configuration file (smartd.conf) at the desired location.
- NetBSD support added
- A new Directive (-s) for smartd.conf now enables flexible automatic
  scheduled self-testing for both ATA and SCSI devices.
- Solaris now has ATA device support (SPARC only)
- A new Directive (-n) for smartd.conf to avoid spinning up disks
- Errors when smartd sends mail are now logged to SYSLOG
- Solaris smartd mail now works correctly (uses mailx not mail)


Date: 2003-11-29
Summary: smartmontools release 5.26
-----------------------------------
This is a stable smartmontools release.  The only known problem is
that under Solaris, the email features of smartd do not work 'out of
the box'.  Three workarounds are:
  [1] use '-M exec mailx' in /etc/smartd.conf
  [2] in the start script for smartd, put /usr/ucb into PATH before
      /bin
  [3] upgrade to release 5.27 or later, or the latest CVS snapshot


Date: 2003-11-19
Summary: smartmontools release 5.25
-----------------------------------
This release should not hang when accessing USB devices. It provides
smartd SCSI self-test log monitoring for self-test errors, and a
larger table of known ATA drives.  DEVICESCAN should work correctly
even on file systems containing XFS or JFS partitions, and on machines
that use devfs, even without traditional links.

From this time on, even numbered releases will be 'stable' ones and
odd numbered releases (like 5.25) will be unstable/testing/development
releases.


Date: 2003-10-30
Summary: smartmontools release 5.23
-----------------------------------
This release has one known problem: DEVICESCAN device scanning does
not work correctly if the disk with the /dev directory also has XFS
or JFS file systems on it.


Date: 2003-10-28
Summary: smartmontools release 5.22
-----------------------------------
Replaces flawed 5.21 release: the -T verypermissive option had to be
entered as -T verpermissive. First experimental solaris support (SCSI
only).  This release had a serious flaw: smartd left open file descriptors
for devices that it couldn't monitor.


Date: 2003-10-14
Summary: smartmontools release 5.21
-----------------------------------
Preliminary support for FreeBSD added to smartmontools.  For FreeBSD,
ATA support requires a 5.1-CURRENT kernel while SCSI support should
work across multiple versions (any that support CAM).


Date: 2003-10-04
Summary: smartmontools release 5.20
-----------------------------------
Replaces flawed 5.19 release (which had a zero-length man page
smartd.conf.5).


Date: 2003-10-03
Summary: smartmontools release 5.19
-----------------------------------
This is the first release of smartmontools based on autoconf/automake.
For this reason, it is a very experimental release.  Please let us
know in particular about documenation errors/omissions, missing or
unneccesary files, and similar oversights.  The major changes are:
 [1]  installation scripts based on autoconfig/automake
 [2] ./configure [options] lets you set arbitrary paths
 [3] supports FHS with ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
 [4] correct paths are inserted into all man pages, binaries, etc.
 [5] tarballs and RPMs are now GPG-signed


Date: 2003-10-02 11:35
Summary: smartd SEGV
--------------------
Some versions of smartd, including smartmontools release 5.1-18, will
SEGV if the combination of Directives in /etc/smartd.conf contains
-l error
AND/OR
-l selftest
without any Attribute monitoring Directives.  This is fixed in 5.19
and above.

A good workaround is to add:
-o on
OR
-o off
to enable or disable automatic offline data collection.


Date: 2002-11-17 07:41
Summary: testunitready bug in smartd
------------------------------------
A bug in smartd prevented functioning on scsi devices.
The bug in question only affects smartd users with scsi devices.
To see if your version of smartd has the testunitready() bug, do
smartd -V
If the version of the module smartd.c in a line like:
Module: smartd.c revision: 1.66 date: 2002/11/17
has a revision greater than or equal to 1.30, and less than or
equal to 1.64, then your version of the code has this problem.

This problem affected releases starting with RELEASE_5_0_16 up to and
including RELEASE_5_0_43.
