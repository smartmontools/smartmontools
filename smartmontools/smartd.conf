# Sample configuration file for smartd.  See man smartd.conf.

# Home page is: https://www.smartmontools.org

# smartd will re-read the configuration file if it receives a HUP
# signal

# The file gives a list of devices to monitor using smartd, with one
# device per line. Text after a hash (#) is ignored, and you may use
# spaces and tabs for white space. You may use '\' to continue lines.

# The word DEVICESCAN will cause any remaining lines in this
# configuration file to be ignored: it tells smartd to scan for all
# ATA and SCSI devices.  DEVICESCAN may be followed by any of the
# Directives listed below, which will be applied to all devices that
# are found.  Most users should comment out DEVICESCAN and explicitly
# list the devices that they wish to monitor.
DEVICESCAN

# Alternative setting to ignore temperature and power-on hours reports
# in syslog.
#DEVICESCAN -I 194 -I 231 -I 9

# Alternative setting to report more useful raw temperature in syslog.
#DEVICESCAN -R 194 -R 231 -I 9

# Alternative setting to report raw temperature changes >= 5 Celsius
# and min/max temperatures.
#DEVICESCAN -I 194 -I 231 -I 9 -W 5

# First ATA/SATA or SCSI/SAS disk.  Monitor all attributes, enable
# automatic online data collection, automatic Attribute autosave, and
# start a short self-test every day between 2-3am, and a long self test
# Saturdays between 3-4am.
#/dev/sda -a -o on -S on -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03)

# Monitor SMART status, ATA Error Log, Self-test log, and track
# changes in all attributes except for attribute 194
#/dev/sdb -H -l error -l selftest -t -I 194

# Monitor all attributes except normalized Temperature (usually 194),
# but track Temperature changes >= 4 Celsius, report Temperatures
# >= 45 Celsius and changes in Raw value of Reallocated_Sector_Ct (5).
# Send mail on SMART failures or when Temperature is >= 55 Celsius.
#/dev/sdc -a -I 194 -W 4,45,55 -R 5 -m admin@example.com

# Monitor impending failure status. The remaining wear ratio is less than 5%, 
# the remaining available space is less than 10%, the remaining available 
# time is less than 30 days,  and the wear rate is greater than 1 DWPD.
# When the remaining wear ratio is less than 5% or the remaining 
# free space is less than 10%, an email alarm is sent. To use this function, 
# you need to configure --enable-impending-failure-check during compilation.
#/dev/sda -E 5,10,30,1 -m admin@example.com

# An ATA disk may appear as a SCSI device to the OS. If a SCSI to
# ATA Translation (SAT) layer is between the OS and the device then
# this can be flagged with the '-d sat' option.
#/dev/sda -a -d sat

# A very silent check.  Only report SMART health status if it fails
# But send an email in this case
#/dev/sdc -H -C 0 -U 0 -m admin@example.com

# First two SCSI disks.  This will monitor everything that smartd can
# monitor.  Start extended self-tests Wednesdays between 6-7pm and
# Sundays between 1-2 am
#/dev/sda -d scsi -s L/../../3/18
#/dev/sdb -d scsi -s L/../../7/01

# Monitor 2 SATA (not SAS) disks connected to a 3ware 9000 controller which
# uses the 3w-sas driver (Linux). Start long self-tests Tuesdays
# between 1-2 and 3-4 am.
# On FreeBSD /dev/tws0 should be used instead
#/dev/twl0 -d 3ware,0 -a -s L/../../2/01
#/dev/twl0 -d 3ware,1 -a -s L/../../2/03

# Monitor 2 disks connected to the first HP SmartArray controller which uses
# the Linux cciss driver. Start long self-tests on Sunday nights and short
# self-tests every night and send errors to root.
#/dev/sda -d cciss,0 -a -s (L/../../7/02|S/../.././02) -m root
#/dev/sda -d cciss,1 -a -s (L/../../7/03|S/../.././03) -m root
