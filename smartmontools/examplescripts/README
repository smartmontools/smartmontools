This directory contains executable shell scripts, that are intended for
use with the
  -m address -M exec /path/to/an/executable
Directive in /etc/smartd.conf.

Details about how to use this Directive may be found in the man pages for
smartd and smartd.conf.
  man 8 smartd
  man 5 smartd.conf
should display those pages on your system.

If you wish to contribute additional scripts to this collection,
please email them to <smartmontools-support@lists.sourceforge.net>,
and include a brief description to use below.

The files contained in this directory are:

Example1: Appends values of $SMARTD_* environment variables and the output
          of smartctl -a to the normal email message, and sends that
          to the email address listed as the argument to the -m
          Directive.

Example2: Appends output of smartctl -a to the normal email message
          and sends that to the email address listed as the argument
          to the -m Directive.

Example3: Uses wall(1) to send a warning message to all users, then powers
          down the machine.

Example4: Uses powersave-notify to issue a desktop neutral warning.
          (/etc/smartmontools/run.d/10powersave-notify from Debian package)

Example5: Uses run-parts(8) to run scripts from /etc/smartmontools/run.d/.
          (/usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner from Debian package)

Example6: Sends a warning mail and then notifies the users by direct write
          to terminals.
          (/usr/libexec/smartmontools/smartdnotify from Fedora package)
