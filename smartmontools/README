== CREDITS ==
This code was originally developed as a Senior Thesis by Michael Cornwell
at the Concurrent Systems Laboratory (now part of the Storage Systems
Research Center), Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University of
California, Santa Cruz. http://ssrc.soe.ucsc.edu/


== OVERVIEW ==
smartmontools contains utilities that control and monitor storage
devices using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology
(S.M.A.R.T.) system build into ATA and SCSI Hard Drives. This is used
to check the reliability of the hard drive and to predict drive
failures.  smartmontools Version 5.x is designed to comply to the
ATA/ATAPI-5 specification (Revision 1).  Future releases of
smartmontools (Versions 6.x and 7.x) will comply with the ATA/ATAPI-6
and ATA/ATAPI-7 specifications.

This package is meant to be an up-to-date replacement for the
ucsc-smartsuite and smartsuite packages, and is derived from that
code.


== CONTENTS ==
The suite contains two utilities:

smartctl is a command line utility designed to perform S.M.A.R.T. tasks
	 such as disk self-checks, and to report the S.M.A.R.T. status of
	 the disk.

smartd   is a daemon that periodically monitors S.M.A.R.T. status and
         reports errors and changes in S.M.A.R.T. attributes to syslog.

This will create a subdirectory called smartmontools containing the code.

To instead get the 5.38 release:

svn co http://svn.code.sf.net/p/smartmontools/code/tags/RELEASE_5_38/sm5 smartmontools

You can see what the different tags are by looking at

== BUILDING/INSTALLING SMARTMONTOOLS ==

Refer to the "INSTALL" file for detailed installation instructions.

See the "WARNINGS" file for reports of hardware where these utilities
might cause serious problems such as lockups.

== GETTING STARTED ==

To examine SMART data from a disk, try:
  smartctl -a /dev/hda
for ATA disks, or
  smartctl -a /dev/sda
for SCSI disks.  See the manual page 'man smartctl' for more
information.

To start automatic monitoring of your disks with the smartd daemon,
try:
  smartd -d
to start the daemon in foreground (debug) mode, or
  smartd
to start the daemon in background mode.  This will log messages to
SYSLOG.  If you would like to get email warning messages, please set
up the configuration file smartd.conf with the '-m' mail warning
Directive.  See the manual page 'man smartd' for more information.
