# This patch is now against the official 3ware version 1.02.00.036 3w-xxxx.c driver
# dated Wed Jul 16 20:30:28 2003. Apply it by following the instructions below.

#
# Adam Radford has incorporated a change that now allows the 3w-xxxx
# driver to return the Cylinder Low/High values.  These are needed to
# get the SMART health status.  This patch incorporates those changes
# as well.
#
# August 12, 2003
#
# 3ware has incorporated a more general version of this fix into their latest
# 3w-xxxx driver release. Rather than using this patch, you can upgrade your 
# 3w-xxxx driver to version 1.02.00.037 or greater.  Or you can use this patch.

# To apply this patch, save this entire file to 3w-xxxx.txt in a
# directory containing the original unpatched 3w-xxxx.c file. Then
# given the command:
#                     patch < 3w-xxxx.txt
# That's it!
#
# TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF THE PATCH FOLLOWS.  SKIP IT IF YOU DON'T CARE.
#
# The 3w-xxxx SCSI RAID driver for 3ware Escalade controller cards has a bug
# in the "passthru" ioctl() which prevents two SMART commands from being
# passed to the ATA devices behind the controller. The commands are:
# 
#  SMART ENABLE/DISABLE ATTRIBUTE AUTOSAVE 
#  (Command Register=0xB0/Feature Register=0xD2)
# 
#  SMART ENABLE/DISABLE AUTOMATIC OFF-LINE
#  (Command Register=0xB0/Feature Register=0xDB)
# 
# [Note: the second of these commands is listed as "Obsolete" in the ATA
# specifications.  It was originally defined in SFF-8035i.  Most vendors
# (IBM/Hitachi, Maxtor, Samsung, WD, among others) still implement it for
# backwards compatibility.]
# 
# The problem arises because in both cases (stupidly!) the ENABLE subcommand
# is indicated with a nonzero value of the Sector Count Register.  For the
# AUTOSAVE command one uses Sector Count Register=0xF1 and for the AUTOMATIC
# OFF-LINE command one uses Sector Count Register=0xF8.
# 
# This provokes the following error messages from the 3w-xxxx driver:
#   3w-xxxx: tw_ioctl(): Passthru size (123392) too big.
#   3w-xxxx: tw_ioctl(): Passthru size (126976) too big.
# and the driver doesn't pass the ATA command on.  This is because the
# passthru part of the 3w-xxxx driver assumes that the value in the Sector
# Count Register is the number of 512-byte blocks to transfer, and these
# values exceed the internal buffer sizes.
# 
# In fact both of these are non-data commands, and so this is trivial to
# fix.  I am attaching an 8-line patch for this purpose.  It looks for these
# particular commands and then treats them as non-data commands. It has been
# tested on both a 6800 and a 7500 controller, and should be endian-order
# and 32/64-bit clean.
# 
# [Note: the normal linux ide drivers also assume that the Sector Count
# Register is the number of 512-byte sectors to transfer to user space.  
# But in that case the user can simply allocate a userland buffer large
# enough to hold the 0xf1*0x200 or 0xf8*0x200 bytes, and then ignore the
# contents.]
