This directory contains executable bash scripts, that are intended for
use with the
  -m address -M exec /path/to/an/executable
Directive in /etc/smartd.conf.

Details about how to use this Directive may be found in the man pages for
smartd and smartd.conf.
  man 8 smartd
  man 5 smartd.conf
should display those pages on your system.

If you wish to contribute additional scripts to this collection,
please email them to <smartmontools-support@lists.sourceforge.net>,
and include a brief description to use below.

The files contained in this directory are:
