Testing
-------
Test with SCSI devices (I can't do it -- Bruce)

Extensions
----------
Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-6 (support for extended error logs)

Produce version for ATA/ATAPI-7

Modifications
-------------

smartctl: 
---------
Handle extended error and self-test logs gracefully.  Can someone tell
me a disk that supports more than log pages 1 and 6?  I need to get a
disk so I can test this functionality, when I add it.

Perhaps modify the -q option (quiet mode) so that it only warns of ATA
errors if they have (say) taken place in the last 168 hours (week).

Change input command line from using current command line format
(getopt) to getopt_long() for long input options.  This will be
helpful in adding device specific options.

Parse and print more attribute flag meanings (IBM ones, eg performance
etc).

smartd:
-------
Perhaps change smartd to look in /proc/ide and /proc/scsi to see what
exists? If something doesn't exit then don't try to open it?  This
should probably be the default option if there is no configuration
file.

Add following config file directives:
  -f                    enable autosave of attributes
  -o                    enable automatic offline testing

Use daemon (8) function instead of do-it-yourself daemon_init().  But,
does it close all open file descriptors?  Must read glibc code to see:
documentation unclear.


General Fixes
-------------

Fix lots of syntax like if (a != 0)
